healthanxiety,Nomis176,2018/01/01,"Final doctor appointment tomorrow, tired of constantly seeking reassurance! Ive decided that Im having my final doctor appointment tomorrow, this is something that has been a huge battle for me, but over the last weeks I have decided that this is the only way I can and will make it out of this anxiety.


Here is the deal: I have been experiencing multiple symptoms as mentioned before in other posts, the symptoms have varied from Brain fog, dizzyness, blurred vision, sore throat, swollen tonsils, coating on my tongue (yellow and white) very reduced energy, fatigue and headaches. The thing is that my sore throat and coating on my tongue wont go away, and my doctor said to come back if it didnt fade over time, the other symptoms tend to come and go so Ive kinda figured out that these are my main anxiety symptoms, which is good because then I know when im getting anxious and stressed out!

Ive been a very heavy caffeine user over the past 2-3 years and ive tried to minimalize the usage of it, as I figured out that i basicly needed caffeine to function at times. Today i used a bigger dosage of caffeine and it really got me feeling off, so I guess i will be dropping it off completely, atleast for now when im feeling anxious and stressed out about my health situation.

Even though I feel somewhat weak and off, Ive learned a lot from this fear of health problems, and I personally think that it had made me a more strong and better person. Tomorrow I will have my final chat with my doctor and I am ready to accept his word for  the truth, hopefully this will take my mind to other places.

1. Seeing healthy people and wishing you were like them (even though you probably are healthy but your brain is telling you you’re not)
2. Changing daily routines based off the health issue you think you have at the time
3. Changing your entire diet to become healthier (for me it has been limiting carbs and sugars because I’m afraid of developing diabetes)
4. Checking your pulse all the time to make sure your heart is beating properly (unfortunately for me my heart is never beating normally, I have constant heart palpitations and my heart races a lot, not even sure if it’s due to anxiety. I’m scared it’s something serious)
5. Having very bad mental health days where you can’t leave your house (this happens to me a lot)
6. Not knowing if your symptoms are caused by anxiety or something serious (this drives me absolutely insane)
7. Not being able to lead a normal productive (for me I can’t hold a job, because I always fear something bad will happen to me at work and I’ll panic)
8. Being triggered by seeing things on shows or in movies. For instance, a man has a heart attack in the show your watching and then you freak out about having a heart attack
9. Obsessively looking up symptoms and not being able to stop once you start
10. Wasting a ton of money on doctors appointments only for them to say you’re okay
11. Being in tons of debt from going to the ER because you think you’re dying
12. Always looking for reassurance from others, obsessively asking others if they ever have the same symptoms as you so you don’t feel alone

healthanxiety,Ajwwr82,2018/01/02,"I've been crying all day - sure my time is up About 3 years ago, a good friend of mine passed away from acute leukemia at the age of 19. I was devastated, and with a lifelong battle with health anxiety it always lingered in my mind anytime I would get ill. Would this be the time I faced the same fate?

Well now this time I'm more or less certain that the time has come. I came down with some infection from a coworker back on November 18th. At first is was merely a slight sore throat, some coughing, malaise. I began to feel better around the end of November. Then the first week of December the sore throat came back. And fever, severe congestion, cough, fatigue, achy muscles amongst other things. I began to feel better from that, but have not been the same since. As of right now, I have a terrible cough, irritated throat , congestion. I have been having night sweats where my neck and head get very damp, but I am not drenched and it only affects the head and neck. I am simply not myself. 

The positives that have kept me hopeful I do not have acute leukemia :
-I have been able to make it to the gym to lift about 3-4 times a week. I don't have much motivation to do so, but I make it and my strength is still there. 
-I have not lost any weight, gained a few pounds actually, currently at 6'0"" and 220 pounds
-when I do feel bad, I'm never running a fever, my temp is usually somewhere between 96.9 and 98.5
-I'm not bruising at all, even after bumping into things, and I don't have any petechia anywhere to suggest low platelets
- my infections haven't been severe, per se. I haven't had sore throats like that of strep and no mouth sores or bleeding gums , they've just been persistent 
- I've been going out on the weekends with friends for a few drinks, which ironically when I am not sober I do not experience night sweats at all
- the guy who originally got me sick is still sick himself, and my entire family is sick back and forth

But nonetheless, I can't help but think this is it for me. I just keep looking at pictures of my mom or baby sister or handmade birthday cards from my sister - just little sentimental things - and I start crying like a baby. I don't want to leave them, I don't want my family and friends to go through what my friend's loved ones went through three years ago when they lost her, I love life so much and I don't want it to end. It's all I can think about though.  I don't really know where to go from here.

I am extremely tired all day as if I had multiple sleepless nights in a row, while I actually sleep 11 hours per night. I'm Feverish (but no fever most of the time), I feel like my forehead and eyes are hot and heavy, cold chills with sweating, extreme fatigue, muscular pain all over.

healthanxiety,TeezusRa,2018/01/02,"Finally getting better. My anxiety was to a point where every few days I was posting in the sub and r/Anxiety. I suspect my anxiety was worsened by being on antibiotics, at pretty heavy doses destroying my gut bacteria, and a hormone imbalance from going on and off of birth control after 5 years of being on it (been off it for 3 months now). Noticed it was WAY worse in the week leading up to my period, the week of, and a week after. This cycle, I actually only had anxiety *during*, and before it was because I was flying (huge fear of mine). Whatever imbalances I had, I think they've finally begun to balance out.

Now, my only health fear at this moment is a DVT from the flight from LAX to Hawaii, even though I know it's mostly from long haul flights, and I obsessively made sure to move in my seat as much as possible... not to mention I was rather active during my stay in Hawaii. My left leg has some weird muscle twitches every so often, but none of the other symptoms-
 in fact the twitches aren't even a symptom. But damn, I'm so much better than I was at my peak anxiety weeks. 

This year, going to go to therapy, and I've started exercising (though I'm afraid my heart will give out despite being only 21, pretty healthy with a perfect EKG and no health issues, and a former athlete, my heart races bc I'm simply just out of shape... baby steps). 

What helped me a lot was writing down my instances of anxiety, and working through them. It's called ABC therapy model used in CBT. http://images.slideplayer.com/20/6041594/slides/slide_10.jpg

When I wrote down my current fixation, such as a brain tumor, I wrote down why I felt that way (even symptoms!), reasons why it's probably not likely (had two physical brain checks, docs said I was fine just head and neck tension, and I didn't have any severe symptoms). Then I wrote how I felt after working through it.

Pinpointing my anxiety to particular times, such as my period, helped me realize that it's really likelu just a hormonal thing, and ya know, every time I was about to be or on my period I probably didn't have cancer or a tumor or some horrible disease or ailment because I knew it was most likely just anxiety. I encourage you all to journal your anxiety! It helps you see trends, it helps a ton to rationalize.

Lately I've noticed that my stool has been softer, floating, and generally flatter than before.  They are not absurdly flat, you'd only notice it if you examined them closely because they float around. I've really noticed this over the past couple of weeks. I haven't really had a solid and long stool in a while. In addition to this, I've been having some dull abdominal pain that kind of radiates on my sides and in the middle of my abdomen. Nothing that keeps me from walking around and exercising though. The pain radiates for a couple of minutes and subsides when I stop thinking about it.

I went to the doctor two weeks ago complaining about the abdominal pain (this was before I noticed anything about the poop). I had a blood test and a urine test taken and basically they came back all clear. 

For the record, I'm 19, male, and overweight. My college diet combined with inaccessibility to the gym has caused me to gain weight over the past two years.

My biggest questions for are these: When is the right time to contact my doctor again? Since the blood and urine tests came back completely normal, is it right to assume that my stool is just a byproduct of me being anxious and general change of diet? I'm on my school's winter break.

Recently, I started asking my friends that don't have anxiety how they deal with strange feelings in their body. Every single one of them says that they almost immediately dismiss the thought. I can't even imagine what that feels like. I focus on a part of my body so much sometimes that I actually create pain that doesn't exist. So I dug a little bit deeper and asked what happens if they were walking around one day and all of a sudden they noticed that their left arm was weak and tingly. Most of my friends with without anxiety said the same thing. I guess my arm is weak today. And then that's it. If they have a headache or if they have a chest pain or if they have an upset stomach or if their leg hurts out of nowhere they just shrug it off and think oh I guess today I'm going to have a stomach ache or I guess I'm coming down with something or something to that nature. And then if it still hurts the next day they shrug it off again and only when it's continuing to do it for like a week do they actually think I'll maybe I should go to the doctor and have it looked at. But it's not in a panicky kind of way it's just kind of like almost annoyance.

Let me start of by saying that for most of my life i think i have symptoms and i think im gonna die everytime untill i finally go to the doctor aand find out its some minor problem.

Ok so in spring of 2015 i noticed the muscle above my knee was twitching a lot so i got into the habit of feeling that area every day until i noticed a hard lump developing on my bone. I was CERTIAN i had bone cancer until i found out i had osteochondroma wich is a benign tumor and not life threatining. I decided not to have it removed.

Two years later (this last summer) i started have muscle twitches all over my body. Those lasted like 5 months and they still happen occasionally but mostly they've been replaced by painful/tender spots on various bones in my body including my spine.

Anyways the bones in my feet hurt a lot and in my hands. Butttt basically every bone in my body has a spot where it hurts.

My pee also started burning last summer and i was tested for various STDs  and the doctor just kinda brushed it off just like he did with all of the other symptoms im describing. And idk if this is related but ive been constipated for 11 days but i can go with laxatives.

I usually go to the gym but havent in a week in a half due to travel and ive actually gained 20 pounds (in muscle) over the last 6 months.

What i really want to know is there ANY possibility that this isnt serious?

And for those wondering i'm going to the doctor to get this checked out as soon as im back in town.

Also i stopped taking my adhd meds about a month ago that id been taking for 5 years",2.19102540834846,3.81714078654971,4.32860859044162,85.0334210526316,76.8070175438596,7.17338173018754,23.1966122202057
healthanxiety,jasmin3jad321,2018/01/04,"Hey guys. Please check this out. My heart goes out to all of you experiencing this. It is crippling and mental torture when it gets out of hand and it feels like it has so much control over you. The world definitely puts enough things out there to scare us, but not enough to comfort us and assuage our fears. There is definitely a lack of balance and it's so frustrating because mental health is SO important. Anxiety can make you feel like you are going crazy and to me, that is the scariest and most deeply troubling symptom. The feeling that I can't trust my mind/myself and that I've lost who I am completely and I'll never be the same. That's what fear and anxiety can do to you when not properly addressed! That being said, after WEEKS of constantly- and I mean CONSTANTLY- searching on google for self-help, I have FINALLY found a resource that is starting to help me. Most of the resources I've found only scratch the surface and are really tailored to mild anxiety- they don't really help. I am only on the second module, but this is the most helpful source I have found for this illness and I am hopeful that I will get better. Please please pleaseeeee at least look at this. Give it a chance and open your mind to the possibility that you can be okay again.

healthanxiety,thebosninski,2018/01/05,"Should a low blood pressure and pulse rate be concerning at an odd time? I was at this enormous concert recently (over 10,000 people in one room, 5 big screens, lord knows how many speakers, etc). It was the first concert I've ever been to because I don't really like loud noise, but there were a couple speakers there I wanted to see (it was more of a conference with several hours of music). Previously unbeknownst to me, the music was incredibly loud and there were continuous lights flashing all different colors and directions. I'm a pretty introverted, quiet guy so this wasn't my idea of a good time, but that's not confusing.

What confuses me is that my pulse dropped. It was a day long event, but I'm in good shape so I doubt that was an issue. I noticed because I started getting dizzy, got a headache, and was tired enough to sit and close my eyes amidst all the *hype*. To my chagrin and embarrassment several people asked me if I was okay (which I appreciated but felt deeply uncomfortable with). My resting heart rate is about 64, and I'd thought it'd be elevated with the very overwhelming (to me at least) stimulus for an extended period of time. Instead, I measured it, and it was right at 42. Wtf was going on? I didn't leave because I didn't want to ruin everyone's time, but seriously, is something wrong with me? No one else had this. It made me feel alienated and uncomfortable when I should have been having a great time. I've never had a panic attack or any prolonged health issues so idk what happened.

She got used to that cause i was cooking , cleaning and doing regular home stuff in all those years before her recovery. 

But i cant handle it anymore , i am diagnosed with mild - severe anxiety with ocd and depression.

First time posting here. So grateful to have found this community. I have struggled with HA for the last 10 years, with each year worse than the one before. 

For the last 6 months, my HA has been with leukemia. Usually my anxiety with any illness is from a few days to a few weeks, but never on the order of months. Enough is enough! I no longer want to live in fear of any random bruise (I am thin and bruise like a peach), or to have my husband constantly reassure me that I don’t have cancer and engage in my safety behaviors. 

A relative of mine is actually a clinical psychologist who deals with anxiety disorders. She referred me to a well-respected clinic that is able to work with my insurance and they want to schedule me for the intake. 

The problem? I’m scared to actually take the next step and start therapy. I’ve avoided dealing with my triggers and upbringing that promoted me becoming this way. The clinic specializes in exposure therapy for anxiety disorders and I am so scared thinking about putting myself in even controlled situations that will manufacture my anxiety. 

Has anyone successfully done therapy and conquered the HA monster? I just need to pick-up the phone and make the call. Would love to make progress on this in 2018. Help?",5.44598506069094,7.25968500840336,6.02717086834734,75.4009990662932,68.6638655462185,10.1628384687208,32.9701213818861

Not sure if I can classify it as 'tremors'

Basically, from what I've seen with different kinds of videos regarding tremors, it doesn't look like it.

Let's say I put my hands in the air facing my palm, or just in the bed resting, it doesn't shake or what.

But sometimes, if I look at them long enough, I notice it they slightly move.

Not sure if I'm doing it voluntarily, I'm being anxious, thus, making it move, or maybe because I'm not used to holding that kind of position, it kinda moves because of it?

I've never had either, and at the time I didn't know that panic attack symptoms can mimic heart attacks. I had a friend take me to the ER, and I was freaking out in the ER while waiting to be seen. I remember thinking ""man, this is it, this is how I'm going to die and I'm away from family, wife and kids and everyone I love and I'm stuck in a place I hate"" and it scared me so badly.

There's been a few times in the past few months where if I wasn't taking medication, I could've had a pretty bad attack. One of them was last week, where my mind just kind of ran away while I was driving home from work and for some reason my mind was looping ""you're gonna die, and probably run into oncoming traffic, look now you're barely breathing"" and I had to calm myself down. It sometimes takes me a really long to get calm, and sometimes I can calm myself almost immediately.

Basically, I had an old dog, like 14 years old. He started sleeping a lot more around Christmas, and all, and when I cold front blew in that week, he started having a harder time walking around (he'd been wobbly already), and then Thursday he collapsed on his front legs and couldn't eat back up. His front legs couldn't move, but back legs were fine, and he ate and drank what we gave him fine. 

During that Thursday I absent minded lot scratched the inside of my nose after doing something and he licked, which is what started the paranoia.

My poor dog couldn't move, but his back legs still could--- and his jaw never got paralyzed and he never got the excess salivating deal.

We have him pain meds at a vets advice, which seemed to of gotten his front legs working again, still back legs working too, he just couldn't get up yet. But he was moving more, his head too. He even ate that day. Unfortunately, he started bloating, fell into a coma, and died that day, which was New Years.

I've brought my paranoia up with the vet, and he did say with everything I told him and showed him that rabies shouldn't even be a concern. Another commenter seemed to agree too.

And--- yeah, I know better--- he wasn't even paralyzed in that way, it was the pain in his bones--- the pain meds helped him, in those final moments. And he never had a hanging mouth, he could move it and eat fine, and didn't foam or excessively salivate or anything. But even still, I've been absolutely paranoid every since despite knowing better. Despite knowing that wouldn't of been rabies, since if it was his limbs wouldn't of gotten better--- but my mind keeps telling me what if it is, what if it is--- what if it's too late and you'll have it and your mom will have it and you'll die--

healthanxiety,DixielandDisaster,2018/01/09,"I feel really silly posting this but... I think I’ll feel better if I get this off my chest. I definitely have some health anxiety, although it’s not as bad as it could be. I recognize that many of the symptoms I feel from time to time are a result of internalizing stress and are made worse by worrying about them, and I think I’ve gotten a better handle on it as the years have gone by.

But I don’t think anxiety can cause lumps or make them grow, and I’m trying to stay away from Google and redirect my focus but I’m still feeling that worry and wanting to check on the lump every five minutes. I think I’ve done a fairly good job keeping myself in check and only examining the lump once a day. But I’m going to write this out and see if it helps. Maybe someone else has had a similar story and everything turned out fine? I want to hear it if so.

Close to a year ago now, I noticed this lump under my arm. I thought it was an ingrown hair. Mentioned it at a checkup, the doctor felt it and thought it was a lymph node. She offered to do an ultrasound but I was getting ready to move out of state and didn’t have time. The lump grew and became really painful and red. For reasons, I didn’t see a doctor until about eight months later, when they diagnosed the lump as an abscess next to a (swollen) lymph node. Abscess was drained, tested positive for Staph, I got a gross course of antibiotics and that was that. The lymph node shrank a little after that and I could still feel a lump where the abscess was. Primary care doctor said it was a cyst that had formed form the abscess being left alone for so long, and sent me to a surgeon to have it removed. The surgeon was not very nice, told me he couldn’t feel anything and sent me home. Eventually the cyst shrank and I couldn’t feel it anymore. 

Fast forward to two months later and now...the original lymph node has shrunk but it’s still around. And now above it there’s a new...mass. It’s next to where the abscess was before but off to the outside top corner of my armpit (sorry for the bad explanation). It’s a hard lump and fixed in place, which freaks me out a bit because google says that’s a sign of cancer. Buuuuuut maybe it’s just my muscle I’m feeling. The other armpit has a bit of that “bump” thing going on at the top, but it’s way less pronounced and feels less like a defined lump, if that makes sense. And it feels like it’s growing. Thanks to the abscess I have a scar and it feels like the lump is noticeably getting closer to the scar. 

I feel like such a drama queen. I’m so embarrassed bringing stuff like this up at the doctor because I’m so used to being dismissed and them thinking I’m a huge baby. I just feel ashamed of being like this. Being stuck between worry or embarrassment isn’t much of a choice. But this nagging voice in my head keeps saying anxiety can’t cause a lump like it could cause a headache or nausea or heartburn or whatever. I just can’t cope with the humiliation if it turns out being nothing and they think I’m an idiot. I have an appointment with my doctor (for something unrelated and not to do with something being wrong with me) and I’m debating on if I should bring it up. My doctor now seems really good and non-judgy, these feelings are internalized. If someone else has had a mysterious bump that vanished one day and ended up being nothing please let me know.

I've always had thick hair that would grow pretty quickly. Now my hair's gotten thin and quite dry. The thinning is more extreme on the sides of my head with visible patches; at the top there arent any such patches (but still thinning and dryness).  I impulse-bought biotin tablets to help with the thinning, but im hesistant to take them at the moment since nothing's been diagosed yet.


But it's not just the hair. I have also been getting, although not frequent,  a tingling sensation in my right fingers,  and sometimes on a whole hand at times. 

More recently, say the last week or so, my vision's gotten blurry. I don't know if the  blurred vision is  permanent and i've just gotten use to it, or not, but ive definitely had these phases. 

Ive looked up my 'symptoms' and what's come up are thyroid conditions, B12 deficiencies and a whole load more. With B12 deficiency in particular, its symptoms seem to align with mine pretty closely. Other than my symptoms ive mentioned already, B12 deficiency symptoms include 'tiredness' and 'memory loss'- i feel like i have these, or atleast they're more pronounced recently (ive always been fairly forgetful).

healthanxiety,julianolte,2018/01/10,"WARNING: graphic. Stomach Flu, Food Poisoning, or neither? Hello,

last night after going out with my boyfriend to get Mongolian Grill, I got back to his house and my head began hurting like a migraine. What was even worse is a few minutes later, my stomach started feeling weird. I brushed it off and was able to ignore it, however, normally if it is nothing or I am having motion sickness, it dies down after a while. It did not. I began feeling REALLY nauseous, and just plain weird. I was also having a lot of small burps and...gas down there. So then I thought, must be gas as this has happened before. 3 hours go by, and I literally cannot move or I feel like I am going to throw up. We go to his mom’s house, and I try to lay down and sleep. And then I got that feeling maybe 30 minutes later, went to the bathroom, and puked up all of my food. I have never puked so much in my life. It hurt really bad, and to make it worse every 30mins-1hr after that I threw up 8 more times, as you can imagine I got ZERO sleep. It has now been about 5 hours since I threw up, and I feel absolutely fine. My stomach does feel a little raw, as expected. But I am able to sip gatorade and suck on ice chips right now with zero desire to eat. 
This is where things get nastier: about 20 minutes ago I was laying here kind of sitting up, and I felt gas down there so I obviously decided to let it out. Worst mistake because, I SUDDENLY FELT IT WAS WET DOWN THERE. And boy, was it.
I ran full speed to the restroom, and it turns out to be what appeared as a mixture of super watery diarrhea, and vomit. Absolutely disgusting, I showered and here I am now.  hours ago before the last few times I puked I did have to poop, it was weird it came out of nowhere and I went and it was big and soft. And then this!
What makes my boyfriend’s mom suspect it is the stomach flu is because my boyfriend’s sister’s boyfriend threw up the other night too, however, she didn’t get sick, I was nowhere near him, and he had a concussion. I don’t have a fever either (atleast I don’t think I do)?
I feel like food poisoning is the culprit because I have had it before and this same thing happened, besides the bathroom situation from what I remember. Just constant throwing up over and over again. I did eat a lot of lettuce and spinach, so I hope it isn’t e-coli.

Any advice would be appreciated. ",2.76507014997581,4.35035587631027,4.02276729559749,88.0056748911466,75.1425576519916,6.73717142396388,27.1154652475407

healthanxiety,adventuringfroglet,2018/01/10,"the HA just won't quit... So, long time lurker and first time poster. Just have to say how helpful this subreddit is for calming me down during a heath anxiety meltdown!

Background: My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer about 7 years ago, went into remission, was re-diagnosed with stage four bc a year and a half ago, and passed away about six months ago (it had spread to her brain). I'm 23 female and she did not carry any of the BRCA genes.

Around 5 years ago, I felt a small bump in my armpit while doing a self-exam and went into a full blown panic. After about a month of constantly poking and prodding and googling symptoms, I forgot about it and the next time I checked it had disappeared. I noticed it again a year later and had a physical around that time and asked my doctor. She said that it was fine and nothing to worry about (can't remember if she said lymph node or cyst...I was just so excited I was not dying)

Fast forward to six months ago when my mother passed away and I became hyper-aware of anything breast-related. The small lump is currently present. It's come and gone a number of times since I first noticed it years ago, it's always in the exact same spot, lasts for various amounts of time, it's 'biggest' size has never changed, and when it's 'gone' I can kind of feel a little remnant. It's under the skin, not hard (but not exactly soft either), can move around but tends to move with the skin it's directly under. Sometimes when I get poking at it for days on end it hurts a little bit and the skin gets irritated. My aunt has suffered from cysts most of her life and has gotten a lot in her armpits and my step-mother, who is a nurse, has told me that I'm fine.

Basically, I know it's not cancer (most of the signs point to the fact it's not) but Google, of course, tells me that I'm dying of a million different cancers (mostly lymphoma or metastatic breast cancer). I have an annual exam in around a month and I'm going to ask about it for the peace of mind, but I just can't stop worrying about it. Any tips?

healthanxiety,trhowaway5212,2018/01/11,"Do I have Anxiety or Schizophrenia? 18 - Male - 5'8 - Caucasian - no previous diagnosed medical conditions or medications - but I think I have Social Anxiety and mild GAD. No relatives that I know of with schizophrenia (however my dad is adopted so I can't know for sure)

I KNOW only a psychiatrist/gp can diagnose me properly. I am asking here to see if it's worth to do so.

For maybe half a year now I've had constant anxiety of having schizophrenia. It started with me being in school, walking through the corridor and hearing my name being called, even though I know I probably just misheard someone else talking. I went home and googled schiz symptoms, and since then have been constantly worrying about it..

Other symptoms -

Music playing in my head. Can be hard to make it stop. Sometimes when I’ve smoked weed it feels literally impossible to make it stop.

Constantly repeating conversations in my head, or preparing for future ones. Also, it feels like most of my thoughts are thought of as if im in a conversation, if you understand what I mean by that.

Auditory hallucinations (?) - Heard my name being called a couple of separate times when walking around town &amp; in school. However, one time at a night club it happened like 5-8 times in one night, (was quite drunk &amp; anxious the day/evening before). It's NOT in a distinct voice, its just someone else next to me who's talking about something completely different, and my brain just misfires and I hear my name instead.. Also, Idk if it counts as hypnagogic hallucinations but when I meditate I, a random word or sentance can pop up in my head, but it can be in a different voice than my own inner monologue - often someone i know. However it really doesn NOT feel like a voice talking to me, more like intrusive thoughts that are in the voice of someone else (but i’m the one thinking?, its not loud or anything)

Quite often, several times a day, when seeing some random person on the street I recognize someone I know for a split second - then I realize it wasn't them. Saw some interview with a dude with schiz who said this was one of his first symptoms but with cars

Poor control of my inner monologue. I tend to overanalyze every single thought that I have. Because of this I have somehow caught the habit of thinking- Would someone with schizophrenia do this, or does this mean I have schizophrenia?

Seeing things out of the corner of my eye.

Slight sensation that people in school might be talking shit about me (however like 2 seconds after that happens I realize how ridiculous it is)

I have smoked quite a lot of weed the last 2.5 years but lately have not been smoking much at all. It tends to make my anxiety worse and hyperactive - the last time I smoked when i was walking home i was paranoid about anyone looking at me through windows and when I walked past 2 guys I was convinced they were talking about me.

No delusions, paranoia (when sober), depersonalization, social life is good etc. I feel ''sane'' but can not stop having thoughts of schizophrenia.

healthanxiety,tor70,2018/01/11,"HA for two weeks - just discovered what its like Hi all;

So the last two weeks have been a ride for me. I've always had a buildup of wax in my left ear (runs in the family). A few weeks ago I noticed a ringing noise in my left ear. I went to the doctor and they said it was an ear infection. So I started taking antibios ... didnt go away. So today I went to an ENT, who suctioned out my ears and gave me stronger antibiotics and reaffirmed me that this is most definitely a temporary phenomenon and will go away in time (1 week, 1 hour, 1 month ... he said ears take awhile to heal). I had this confirmed by many of my friends that experienced ear infections as well. The ringing will go away, just in time.

The problem is... throughout the past several days, I spent the majority of my time convincing myself that I had some sort of major illness. The first concern was cancer, then that turned into a meningiti, then that turned into inner ear concerns, then that turned into HIV concerns ...

I don't know how I arrived at any of these conclusions. I had no symptoms of any of these illnesses, yet I immediately assumed that I had them. No way do I have meningitis, I would know by now ... no way do I have cancer, it doesnt really run in my family nor do I display any other symptoms. No way do I have aids ... I have not exposed myself in any way that would put me into a situation where it was possible. 

My friends and peers are all convinced I have anxiety issues and need to see a counselor. I went to one last week and she pretty much confirmed that I have anxiety issues that are beginning to manifest themselves in a moderate form of hypochondria. I literally started checking myself every day for things .... lumps, rashes, bruises .... 

I write because I'm curious to know other people's stories. How do you cope with this? This constant anxiety-driven fear of having a major disease. I've spent so much time over my break from school researching illnesses, conditions, symptoms ... trying to connect the dots from anything I could have possibly been exposed to in the past. The slightest itch would terrify me. An ingrown hair on my belt-line convinced me I had an STD.

And as of yesterday my head has settled back on the good ole fear of getting Rhabdomyolysis from powerlifting. Because i think i overdid training yesterday. I had a back injury that kept me from doing specifically squats for like almost a year. So i have been afraid to do them. Deadlift and bench are fine and i go heavy. But i have really only been doing squats on the high volume speed work day. I was doing pause squats with only 1 plate (per side) on the bar. Its way too light and i have been afraid to go heavier.

healthanxiety,MeekosACheeseLover,2018/01/11,"Crippling fear Hey guys, I’m posting this because I want to see if I’m the only one. My grandma passed on her hypochondria to me, and ever since I suffered a spinal injury my sophomore year of highschool I’ve been terrified of doctors visits and every little pain, ache, tingle, and spasm I get in my body. I went to a sports specialist for my back and he diagnosed me with a C5 fracture, and scoliosis. I can live with that. But after I became aware that my body is injured and no longer the same, I’ve been obsessed with the idea that I have cancer, a brain tumor, or MS. Usually it’s cancer that takes over my thoughts.

My thing is, I avoid the doctors office in every way possible. I HATE the idea of going to the doctor, being diagnosed, because to me my life is over at that point. I can usually talk myself through my panic episodes, but I usually seek the reassurance of others. I have a mole on my back and I’m convinced it’s changing, so every other week I ask my girlfriend if it’s changed and she says of course not. I can’t remember what it looked like as a kid, but I could’ve sworn it didn’t look like it does now. My anxiety is so bad I went to the doctor when I had a flu that wouldn’t go away, got chest x-rays to rule out pneumonia, and before my doctor told me the results I told him, “look, if I have cancer I don’t want to know, just don’t tell me” and he looked at me like I was crazy because the X-ray came back perfectly fine, just a common flu.

I’ve avoided the doctors office for so long now that I feel like there HAS to be something wrong. Terminal. I know I should go, but even thinking about the idea makes me shutter with fear. A lot of the posts I read on here are about people that go to the doctor too much, but I wanted to see if there were people out there that are like me.",3.42315649867374,4.13405217771884,4.61937665782493,87.7700198938992,72.315649867374,7.39151193633952,25.9058355437666

healthanxiety,rnavstar,2018/01/11,"IBS/psoriasis My story and never would have thought what was causing it!! I want to share my story because I believe there’s a lot people out there in my situation. 

When I was younger in high school, I would get diarrhea going to class, mostly happened in the morning. This was around the year 1999. I had psoriasis on my head for most of my life. It would get bad from time to time, but never went away.  The doctor would prescribe an ointment that stunk like gasoline. I would put this on head and it felt like it was burning the skin off my skull. So I never really used it, just suffered as is. 

Now back to the diarrhea issue. I went to the doctors and they did everything you could imagine. Blood tests, stool tests, upper and lower GI’s, and the good old colonoscopy! In the end the doctor said that I was a healthy young man. So he diagnosed me with IBS.

Once I graduated from high school it seem to simmer down to where I never really had any more symptoms. So I figured that is was over. 

Years passed by and once in a blue moon the IBS would come back. But the psoriasis never went away. I moved forward in my career, and in my personal life. I thought that the nightmare I had when I was younger would never comeback. Boy I was wrong! One day at work after having something for lunch my captain and I had just taken off we were in the air for all of ten minutes. I looked at him and said we have to go back and land! He asked what was wrong, I replied that I’m going to crap my pants. So we turned the plane around and landed without incident. 

The next day my manager called and asked what had happened and I replied that I must have ate something I shouldn’t have. 

Months rolled by with no farther problems other then the psoriasis. 

I upgraded to captain and loved what I was doing. Then one day, it came back only this time it didn’t go away!! Much worse, I started taking Imodium gel caps one before the flight and as prescribed as many as I need during the flight.(this was a bad idea for me, but we will come back to this)
So off to the doctor I went and of course started to do familiar tests. Only this time after all the testing the doctor didn’t just say it was IBS but it also must be in my head. Now it’s time to send me to a shrink. 

There I am, off work by this point sitting on a couch playing head games at the same time trying not to mess myself. After the third session I said “it’s not in my head, no way!!!

My wife is going crazy by this point with me not working, so off I went with the same problems back to work. The first day I tried to do one flight. Had diarrhea threes times and kept taking Imodium trying to fight it. I didn’t even get the engine started. I went back off work. 

Then my wife said “your going to do whatever I tell you to do now”! I was game because I just wanted this to be over. She sent me to a natural-path doctor, I thought that this was going to be a joke, but played along as I’m willing to do whatever by this point. This ended up being a game changer for me. I told her what was happening, and she said “tell me what you eat I the run of a day”. I told her and she replied that it sounds like a FOOD INTOLERANCE, and that it’s a simple blood test. I said that I already been tested, she replied “that’s for allergies”. 

I agreed to the test. About three weeks later she calls me, say the results are in. I went to see her she said I had three different intolerances one was potatoes another was cane sugar with fruit, and the last most important....soy. 

That day I eliminated all three and within a week all my symptoms were gone including my psoriasis, even the little bumps on the back of my arms went away!!

I was so happy, the only problem now is that I have to prepare all my meals and read every label of anything I want to eat. So living on the road as an airline pilot makes it tough, but I’ve got it down now.

Soy is what was causing all my problems, and if I have it today it comes back at full fold. Now remember how I said I was taking Imodium GEL caps, well one of the ingredients is SOY.  Just like a car, jamming on the brakes while hitting the gas!!

So I had medical problems that regular doctors couldn’t find, went to a naturalpathic doctor and found out that I have a food intolerance to Soy.",2.53112578695941,4.21286184872979,3.68438134708469,89.7767200797241,76.0092378752887,6.59278053718878,23.7567781328103

healthanxiety,ais991,2018/01/12,"Bump on the (fore)head I have noticed that there is a “bump” - it’s bone though, not actual bump as when you bump your head against something - on one side of my forehead. I can definitely see it looking from the profile. I haven’t ever really spent ages investigating my forehead shape, but I’m pretty sure it wasn’t there always - however, I couldn’t tell how long it’s been present either. Years ago I had a pretty bad head injury in an accident, but I was overall ok and haven’t really had any problems since - so I’m guessing it’s probably not directly related, if there is anything... As of recent I have developed strange little symptoms, eg. I feel like I’m clumsier/less well co-ordinated than before and my muscles on one side feel a bit strange/achy sometimes, but these things aren’t very consistent and aren’t really getting worse, they’re probably in my head and they do get better with vitamin B.

I'm a 24 y/o female and in early October 2017 I noticed a lump on the left side of my neck about the size of a pea. Assuming it was from a cold as I had been coughing quite a bit. I let it go until I noticed again in early November it had grown in size. I noticed another under my right jaw and my doctor ordered an ultrasound and the left one measured 1.88 cm x 0.92 cm x 0.98 cm and the right one measured 1.27cm x .76cm x 1.06cm. I had other swollen lymph nodes as well, but this was the one I could feel from the outside.

The ultrasound tech ordered another test through my GP (although my GP was hesitant to sign the form for my follow up) for early January, so I went on the 2nd. The left lymph node is now 1.74cm x 1.03cm X1.0cm and the right lymph node is now 1.79cm x 0.91cm x 1.22cm.

I find myself waking up in the middle of night really hot and sweaty and I have been getting an itchy rash on my stomach that comes and goes.

I'm a little worried because the lymph nodes mentioned (as well as the other 8 or 9 notes in my ultrasound) have seem to have grown in some way or another and I'm hoping my doctor doesn't dismiss it like she did the last time.

I’m 21 now, and the first time anything happened was probably 5 years ago. Doctor did an occult test, found nothing but a hemroid, sent me on my way with a cream and I was fine for a while. It’s happened on and off since then and usually I either know it’s hemroids or I can trace it back to something red I ate. Recently however, it’s gotten worse. About a month ago, as my semester was ending there was about a week where I had stomach pains and twice in that week my stool had these red spots. I went to a local walk in clinic and had another occult test done and it also came back nevative. The doctor said it was probably something I ate. I’ve been fine this past month, but I just flew back from Europe and twice in the past 3 days I’ve noticed the same red spots.

I was kinda already having chest tightness before I looked that up. Reading that made it even worse. 

The reason I can’t tell if it’s panic or not is because I started getting bad anxiety after reading about the flu epidemic and how it caused death and stuff. This was all after taking it.

healthanxiety,lemonpie2605,2018/01/13,"Health Anxiety is ruining my life. So it all started getting worse when about three weeks ago I accidentally got hit in the forehead with a soft car seat... I wasn't knocked out or anything, A &amp; E said I had no serious injuries, no bruise etc. 

My Health Anxiety's like, ""Well how do you know you're fine, you should see a doctor again so that nothing new has come up.""

I go to the doctor, I phone two different doctors and they tell me I don't have any signs of a serious head injury... I end up freaking out a few days later because of persistent headaches and feeling spaced out, so I go to the A &amp; E again, a different doctor gives me a neurological examination and tells me I don't have any serious injuries and should be more concerned about my anxiety. 

Then out of nowhere one of my relatives has a heart attack and is in hospital (he's fine and well now) and I start to worry. A few days after visiting him, I'm at my boyfriend's house and lying in bed... I'm getting these headaches that have lasted about a week now as well as a sudden pain in my arm and chest, and become totally convinced that I'm having a heart attack or a stroke. It doesn't help that I was starving myself because I was so stressed out; I had lost half a stone in the space of a week. I thought that I was dying because I hadn't eaten and was having heart problems because of this.

So now my HA brain thinks I've had a stroke twice without noticing or being diagnosed and that I have a damaged brain and that I also might have a brain tumour.

I've not been able to smell or taste things as well since I got a minor bump on the forehead, but it's quite possibly the case that my anxiety is convincing me I have these symptoms... so I've remained in this constant heightened state of numbness because of my anxiety; believing that I have some sort of serious condition... I was even at an audiologist because I believed that a visit to the cinema had permanently damaged my hearing, everything was fine and he said I had no hearing damage...

I go to the doctor again because of my severe anxiety; she tells me that all of my symptoms (headaches, ringing in ears, loss of sense of smell) are being caused by my anxiety. She prescribes me with propranolol... naturally I look up the side effects and become terrified to take the medication.

Just today, I started getting a headache and was convinced I was taking a stroke again. I've became kind of emotionally numb now because I'm constantly ruminating about what could be wrong with me health-wise. I can't even enjoy things anymore because my HA goes, ""Well maybe you can't enjoy that or feel much emotions or think about that the same way as you did before because you have brain damage caused by an undiagnosed TBI or a stroke."" I can't pay attention to things.

It doesn't matter what the doctors say, after a few hours I'm always convinced that they're wrong and that there's a serious problem with my brain and they haven't been able to find it yet.

I'm so sick of this. Can anyone else relate?

healthanxiety,jstaffy,2018/01/14,"2+ years of relentless HIV anxiety - please read and KEEP CALM For the last couple of years, I have been utterly petrified of HIV. I'd say it has crossed my mind at least once an hour for the last 2 years and 4 months. Statistically, the chances of me having it were  alwaysridiculously small, and none of the science would support the hypothesis that I had contracted HIV.

But some brains work in funny ways. And mine is an example of a brain that immediately believes the worst possible outcome. And I'm sure there are many many many more out there who have wrapped themselves in a similar web of self-loathing and utter panic. The advent of Dr Google is good, but it can also do some terrible things for our mental health.

The solution the whole time was simple: test. Test and set yourself free. It's hugely important on so many levels to know your HIV status. For your own health, for your sexual partner's health. For the sake of the NHS. I am so glad I got tested. I can literally feel a part of my brain resuming activity. It feels strange not carrying around the fear I had been carrying before; it has literally given me a headache as my brain tries to decide how to reallocate this space.

I had ALL the symptoms. Absolutely text book seroconversion illness. Fever, sore throat, swollen glands, night sweats, stomach discomfort, everything. Doctor's presumed it was glandular fever, but tests never confirmed the presence of the EBV (which it should for glandular fever). Classic ARS. Of course, after a couple of weeks I was back on my feet again, and the doctor was quite content.Then about a year after this, I came out in a weird rash that wouldn't go away for like 2 weeks. Seemed like some sort of bacterial infection (to me). And it always got worse in the sun. OBVIOUSLY my immune system was compromised.

From the moment of my ""glandular fever"" my brain had convinced myself I was carrying HIV. But I wasn't brave enough to test. I was being cowardly. However, over the last few months I've been having some stomach issues, which are pretty non-specific, and the internet didn't really help me link it to HIV. The doctor did suggest a CBC test for me though, I think just to get an idea if anything was going on, blood-wise (obviously lol). I was told by the nurse who carried out the blood test that it was very much a case of ""no news is good news"".

Of course, having had the blood test on Monday, first thing on Tuesday I got a call from the doctor. My white blood cell count was low, and she wanted me to come in so she could feel my lymph nodes. AHHHHH! My brain went in to overdrive. I couldn't cope. This was it. My worst fears realised. Why me? Why me?!! That's exactly what HIV does - it attacks white blood cells. Nooooo!

I went in for the doctor's appointment, and she said all my lymph nodes were normally and no cause for concern.

She did then say, ""I would like to test you for HIV"". My world was crumbling inwards. I couldn't believe that this was happening to me, a very conservative, early twentys, heterosexual male. I looked at the statistics to such a deep level, that I knew that in my country of residence, there was only 32 males aged 15-24 who were HIV positive. That's essentially like 0% of the population. I was about to become a medical phenomenon.

The doctor eventually decided just to take the CBC again in 6 weeks time, and that we wouldn't test for HIV just yet (as I kind of freaked out when she suggested the HIV test). But the time was now - I needed to know. I would have no quality of life with this intense level of anxiety coursing through every fibre of my being, every second of the day. I had a second job interview for a pretty plush job that day, and I totally flunked it due to the unbearable mental tension I felt.

I did manage to summon the courage to order a HIV home test kit, which I had delivered to my family home, where I would have the test in the presence of my family so that I could receive immediate support from those closest to me when the test returned a positive result (and in my head, it was very much of WHEN not IF). I spoke to them on the day the doctor said about my low WBC, and they were all wonderfully supportive (did have to speak to my Mum about my sex-life though - not ideal).

So I went home yesterday, and I had the test. And, of course, it was a big fat NEGATIVE. Which it always has been. It was a crucifying 15 minutes waiting for the test to work, but during those 15 minutes, on a deep level I felt a sense of peace. The band aid had been ripped off, and life was going to move on.

HIV is the worst for health anxiety, as almost everything can be linked back to it. The anxiety can make your brain question everything - I was even questioning my ability to swallow at one point. But the chances are, going off the plethora of statistics out there, you don't have it, whoever you are who is out there searching for every piece of HIV research ever (which has been me for the last two years). But still, if the anxiety is as stressful and overbearing as what I was experiencing, you need to get tested. Now. Somehow. Make it happen.

I took the time to write this in the hope that someone who is currently going through a similar thing to what I went through, can find solace in it. You will be alright regardless. You are a good person. But you need to put your mind to rest. You need to have the test. 

'Thinking Fast and Slow' by Daniel Kahneman teaches a brilliant lesson in terms of this. Our brains are desperate to come up with a story that will justify our irrational way of thinking/catastrophising. But numbers matter. Statistics speak volumes. You are not special. You are overwhelmingly likely to be normal. You aren't the 1 in 100,000 shot. You are the 99,999 out of 100,000 shot. Our brains struggle to compute the true values of these numbers, but we must try. 

Peace!

On Monday, I had pain under my armpit and across my chest on the left side. I convinced myself I had everything from breast cancer to heart failure. Went to the doctor on Thursday and she diagnosed me with shingles. My rash is more like a cluster of spots, and it's not itchy or have any of the other symptoms.

Since then, I've convinced myself my organs are failing and that I have a blood clot.

The latest is breast cancer. Was in the shower and noticed a small, about an inch long, patch of skin that's red. No itch, no rash, spot or lumps. It's not hot to touch. It's just red skin. The thing that's throwing me is that it's on my right side, whereas the shingles is on the left.

I blame the school system, at least on my country, because it's made in a way that even when I moved to the US, it just isn't easy to socialize with others because you have to be quiet or talk low, this also gave me troubles with talking low usually, it's hard for me not to, well, I scream a lot when I watch videos (I am kind of crazy xd) but in my comfort zone only and well, I spent most of my days on a pc watching videos and having fun

My parents also just don't know how to take care of a child, you see, I got depression and maybe something else thanks to my dad, he isn't abusive, he does things for a good purpose but the way he does it made me hard to tolerate him (the slightest thing, even just saying a bad joke, if it comes from him it would make me mad over the line, and I don't want to feel like that but I can't avoid it, I dunno why, it's just how he made me). I also don't find anything to do outside my house and that's why I don't even ask to get out of there adding how overprotective my parents are and when I actually do want to they just don't let me (I almost never go to my friends houses, I had a friend who didn't care when I went but hey, after 2 visits I couldn't anymore because of their paranoia and being overprotective, I don't hate them for that, not even mad, I just dislike how few chances I have of doing stuff like that)

I don't feel pretty good now, I was getting too bored in the game and I got tired of not doing a thing in VRChat, my plan was to be a silent person and interact with people but it's hard without VR, and it still gave me the chills to interact with them.

This is annoying, I don't really hate my life, I had fun when I was 10 and didn't have any friends, just spent the whole time watching videos and playing game, and I still had fun when I got friends on the internet or people to talk to (ironically, people ruined that fun ""a little bit"" xd at the price of making it more fun) I am having fun now but now, well, I just handled depression I guess, but talking to people is still something hard to do for me, at least I got friends in my school, but I am still just too quiet and I am annoyed by that, I also find it almost impossible to start conversations, or just impossible (but, without speaking.... meh, it feels like there's no risk, I dunno, when I type I don't think I could mess up, not because of my voice, but it's still pretty hard, but I think that's how it is usually, hard)

healthanxiety,ecn_ln,2018/01/15,"I'm really struggling I've suffered with Anxiety for about 5/6 years now, however in the last year my health anxiety has gotten extremely bad. 
Everywhere hurts at different times or different days and I constantly think I'm going to die. Whether it be a pain in my chest, or a rash on my arm or even if I find a bump one somewhere.

About a year and a half ago I started saying  'touch wood' if I or anyone else said something worrying that might happen. Eg if I said 'I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack' followed by me saying 'touch wood' and then touching something wooden. It made me feel secure, like it made it not true and it wouldn't happen once I said and touched it.

However it then got extremely out of control to the point where any time I even thought about something happening to me I'd tap the side of my head twice (for some reason this was my new 'touch wood instead of trying to find something actually wooden) 
I still say it sometimes, but if I only think of something terrible happening I won't say anything out loud but rather say it in my head and touch my temple twice. I know this sounds crazy weird but I literally can't go a day without doing it now. 

My health anxiety is so bad. I've been reading other posts and I relate to most of them which really stresses me out. I will always go to the worse case scenario and I can't stop. I'm constantly getting pains in my arm or numbness, shortness of breath, chest pains, headaches, shaking etc. I know/hope deep down its my anxiety but I can never calm myself down.

To make it worse my boyfriend gets annoyed at me for 'constantly being sick' ie when I have headaches or even when I get a numb pain or something he usually tells me I'm over reacting which makes me more stressed and upset. 

Idk if this is even the right place to post and even posting it is making me super anxious. I just can't get a moment to relax. My whole life is revolving around my anxiety. Every single day I think of death and how this might be my last day etc.

How do I stop this? I'm really losing my mind.

I went home after finals week and my stress level dramatically decreased as I realized how well I did in my classes and I was able to decompress while at home. I went on a ski trip with my family in the middle of the break, right after Christmas, and I felt no symptoms at any time during that trip. I felt fantastic. As I came home and started to prepare to go back to school, I started feeling anxious that I would fall down into the same anxiety rabbit hole again in the second semester, and gradually the weakness and numbness started to come back. Now that I’ve been back at school for 8 days and the anxiety has persisted (albeit less severe) I’m still feeling tightness in the right side of my neck and in my right leg, as well as weakness and numbness in my right limbs.

healthanxiety,FellowLiverWorrier,2018/01/17,"My Health Anxiety Story and How I am Recovering Hello /r/HealthAnxiety!

Allow me to tell you my health anxiety story and how I am beginning to recover from this psychological illness!

The first precursor to my health anxiety was probably almost a year ago to the date when I felt a bump on my shoulder, which I thought was a tumor. Of course, it ended up being a deeply embedded pimple or cyst and resolved on its own after I went to the doctor who said the same thing. When I went into full-blown panic mode was back in April when I woke up with two puncture marks on my ankle after staying the night at a sister's house. Knowing that they once had an issue with a bat in the attic, I assumed that a magical bat had made its way all the way downstairs, embedded itself in the bowels of my sister's house, and bit me on the ankle. Of course, this magical bat must have had rabies too. Spoiler warning, but I did not die of rabies and am not writing this as a ghost.

My health anxiety probably climbed into a hysteria that consumed me last June. I was going to a university field station when I fell ill. Really ill. Not being able to keep down food or water for three days ill. Thus, I flew home as I had missed much of the class and assumed that I was going to die and wanted to so around family. Yet, again, I did not die, but the ordeal had traumatized me enough to sink into full-time paranoia that I would not escape until October.

Except for the occasional stomach ache things were fine for a month from a physical perspective, but from a mental perspective (if thinking I had terminal skin cancer from a 2mm mole was any indication) I was in rough shape. 

In mid-July, I developed the first sign of a rare birth defect that I did indeed end up having. Now, before you go into a google symptom, allow me to explain what happened: my belly button burst open. It was not painful as I didn't know this had occurred for an hour. It wasn't until I looked down and saw that my outie had turned into a popped inside outie. I walked to the hospital and was diagnosed with cellulitis and told to go to a follow-up with the university doctors. Ultrasound showed nothing. It was only after a CT scan two months later that they saw a 1""x2""x3"" sinus and cyst located behind and below my belly button. The operation was a success and it was removed two months ago. I even got an innie out of the ordeal. In between July and October I had been tested for just about anything and the only thing that came up were elevated liver enzymes and a weird-ass belly button.

In the meantime, I had begun CBT and doubled my dosage of Celexa (which is now down), which helped a lot. Besides teaching me mindful thinking, my therapist became a good outlet to just talk about life and my general grievances that I had been experiencing as a graduating senior from a top state university.

To err on the side of caution, my PCP sent me to a liver specialist to get my liver checked out. They tested me for any liver ailment you can think of, and the only weird thing was my beta globulins- ever so slightly out of range (think 0.1 out of range when usually 1 or 2 out of range indicates an actual problem). Wanting to be as thorough as possible, the pathologist recommended a Bence-Jones Test for leukemias myelomas, and pre-leukemia. The test came back negative. Specialist ruled that it was just an off result due to my immune system still recovering from surgery about two and a half weeks before and I had had no other symptoms consistently. This final test was taken after Christmas break and ordered before it so despite being told I did not have a deadly illness, I stewed over it.

And then, something happened. Something clicked in my head. I was sick of being prodded at and tested. I looked at my medical information logs for every time I visited the doctor and whenever I was with anyone but my PCP, my blood pressure jumped thirty points and pulse went up to 90bpm over 70. Living in America, I realized that doctors will NEVER stop running medical tests unless they are sure they have ruled out a condition. They don't want to get sued and if you have the insurance or money WILL run a test if you are insistent enough. This all hit me in about 24 hours. I decided that should that final test come back negative that I would only go to the doctor if anything were seriously and obviously wrong or for my psychiatric check-ups. I only google things five minutes a day and I do not talk to my doctors over the patient portal- only at appointments.

My status has improved tremendously these past two and a half weeks. I wanted to tell you guys that there is hope, and what you likely suffer from is a psychological issue. It really is. In seven months the only weird things they could find was:
-Elevated liver enzymes, likely prescription or slight fatty liver after a huge barrage of tests
-Maybe some gallbladder sludge/stone
-Weird-ass belly button thing where if you had it would be very obvious or already addressed in your childhood (having it through adulthood so unlikely that they like to write case studies on it)

And guess what? These were and are all very treatable. I came back here to post to tell you guys that it can get better. I felt a twinge in my upper right abdomen and got a little panicked tonight but this was the first time I felt even remotely worried about something in the last two weeks. I don't know if it'll take therapy, different meds, getting sick of tests, or all three, but you can get there.

healthanxiety,NongranularNip,2018/01/18,"Struggling with hantavirus fear... I can't rationalize out of it Hi all.. Never posted here, but I've been struggling with health anxiety for about a year.

I'm just really scared  and anxious right now. I woke up yesterday with a cough which progressed to lung pain. I've never had lung pain, so I think that is where a lot of this fear is coming from. Last night I got a fever, and today I'm pretty sick. Fever, mild sore throat, productive cough, and pretty bad body aches.

See, I'm freaking out about hantavirus because two weeks ago, I dismantled a crappy structure in my sunroom where my dogs hang out. It was really, really dusty. So much dust. I didn't wear a mask or anything. I didn't see any mice or droppings or anything, but there was so much dust. To make matters worse, I live in New Mexico, where hantavirus is most common. I also live in a county where there was a case in 2016.

This just doesn't feel like my normal kind of sick. It started in my lungs, where usually when I get sick my first symptoms is a sore throat and stuffy nose. Now my nose is barely stuffy, but I have a really bad cough. It's been a long time since I've had a fever, and I can't recall getting muscle aches before this.

All the factors combined are freaking me out really bad. I live in the state it is most common, I cleaned out an enclosed space where there was lots of dust, and now two weeks later (within the incubation period) I came down with a sickness that I feel is unusual for me.

Someone please talk to me. I don't know what to do or how to get rid of this crazy fear I feel. I can't stop googling about hantavirus.

I mentioned in my previous post that I have a very oily scalp and a lot of dandruff on my hair and as a result I have bald patches. Some people recommend me to see the doctor for second opinion so I visited another dermatologist today. She was able to diagnose my problem. She said I have a very severe hair loss at a very early age (I'm only 17). The problem she mentioned was androgenic alopecia. She said normally this problem is caused because of genetics but since none of my family members are bald it's probably due to an harmonal imbalance.

healthanxiety,apos10,2018/01/18,"Always think I have cancer So I remember it started in high school where I started having a bump grow on a specific spot on my head and I never had any real fear before this time. I remember sitting in my class googling bump in that location and it said swollen lymph node which could be a sign of cancer. At first I was like ok no it’s probably just a pimple but then two weeks after that I got another one on my head where another lymph node was supposed to be located. I was terrified and I thought this was it. I went to the doctors made them send me to specialists the whole 9 yards and they kept telling me that’s not a lymph node but I was convinced they had no idea what they were talking about because I read so many articles on google. Turns out they were just cysts. 

Since then that has sparked my fear of always thinking I had cancer. That was 3 years ago and since then I have been convinced I had bone cancer, brain cancer and now stomach cancer. 

I have been a heavy weed smoker for a while and I started to get a tightness and cramping pains in my stomach I associated with the weed. So I quit and 2 days after quitting I got really bad runs, I was nauseas, and I threw up a couple times. I lost 15 pounds during this period which was a feeder into yep it’s cancer. The strange thing is when I stared getting better my symptoms only appeared in the morning. 

After this period I thought maybe it was just a sickness and not the weed so I smoked all day everyday again for another week but then started waking up nauseas so I quit again and again a couple days after quitting I got the runs. It’s been brutal and I have since gotten a lot better. Although my stomach still hasn’t gone back to normal I’m now terrified every morning because that’s usually when I go the bathroom and I freak out I have stomach cancer. I wouldn’t leave my doctor alone at the time and made her run so many tests and everything always came back fine. 

I just want to know how some people got over this irrational fear. I’m only 19 and on the cancer statistics website shows less than 1% of people who get this cancer are under 20 and most of them have a family history of it so my chances are very unlikely which I can understand but a part of me is still terrified.

healthanxiety,NameLessTaken,2018/01/18,"Need Support ASAP for rabies fear!! So on January 4th (almost 2 weeks ago) I pet, and gently moved, a friendly cat out of the road by a local restaurant. He let me pick him up under one arm in my fluffy winter coat without too much resistance or fighting back, but darted off a little peturbed once I moved him. He may have lightly dug his claws in for balance and surprise at being moved- but as a germaphobe who is very afraid of cat scratch fever, I feel I would've noticed excessive claws making it through my winter layers.

I went about my night (my birthday night) without much else of a thought for the cat. The next morning I did discover a fair amount of dried bleeding and cut/scraped area on my elbow that I'm still not sure how it came to be. But again, I patched it up and went about my days. Its since healed fine. I wasn't intoxicated, but I had been out dancing late and thought maybe I bumped it at some point.

Fast forward to today, January 17th, and the talk of rabies comes up. Suddenly I remember the cat and mysterious scratch. Surely I would've known if the cat did It? He was friendly, docile, and clean. I figured he belonged to some one living in the city located nearby to the place we were eating at since he was chubby and had a soft clean coat. But now I'm freaked out! Should I talk to my Dr about getting a rabies shot now?! Its been 2 weeks on Saturday.

healthanxiety,teddyinBK,2018/01/18,"I'd been told it was just anxiety for two years, and now I've been diagnosed with a tumor I developed Panic Disorder when I was in college, shortly after the Virginia Tech Massacre. I was a freshman at Virginia Tech when it happened, and my sophomore year, I started to have deep-seeded health anxiety (fear of death, mostly.) I'd suffered through many family deaths before, and psychologists had told me I had PTSD with fear of dying. I DO have health anxiety, and I border on hypochondria. 

HOWEVER!

When you already have a PD diagnosis, or a hypochondria diagnosis, I find that doctors don't take you seriously. I completely understand why they wouldn't: it's tiresome for them when you come in and tell them you're having a heart attack when you're really suffering from GERD. When I first saw a doctor and told her that it felt like I'd broken my rib three times in one year, she sent me to a psychiatrist. The next doctor told me I needed to up my Prozac. Finally, a CT scan showed I have a severe Fibrous Dysplasia tumor in my 10th rib which is growing into my liver, kidney, and diaphragm. I'm scheduled for surgery on March 5th. 

It's hard to know when it's your health anxiety and when it's your health, and GOOD LORD it's tiring for us anxious people to convince doctors that we're having a real problem. I honestly still don't know how to tell the difference, but I'm here to say, SOMETIMES, your gut is right.

I've never gotten the flu. I haven't gotten the shot in a few years too, I believe. My doctor asked me if I wanted it a few months ago, but I foolishly said no at the time because I was in a rush to leave. Boy, do I regret it now.
I go back to college in about 2 weeks, and I am stressed. I suppose it's not too late to go get it, but that doesn't quell my anxiety over the fact it's only 10% effective anyway. Jeez.

Up until last year I was an extremely sedentary 28yo weighing around 265 lbs. I started a new job that is fairly physical and since then I have dropped down to 230ish. Well last week I was laying down and felt something I never felt before in my chest. I went to the doctor and he said it was almost certainly my xiphoid process. I also mentioned I had a general cough (I us an e-cigarette), as well as a periodical tingle under my right shoulder-blade. Other than those three things I felt completely normal.

My doctor said everything felt normal, my blood pressure was normal, as was my pulse and he checked me out with a stethoscope. In the end he ordered an x-ray to be certain. From that appointment up until I got my results I started stressing out (tight chest, sweating, vomiting, trouble sleeping, just overall freaking out about what that x-ray might show). Low and behold I got my result and everything came back looking completely normal. Although that is great news I haven't been able to ditch the tight chest, trouble sleeping with bad thoughts, and general feeling of just being uncomfortable.

I’ve had nexplanon put in my arm, but the stories online of women getting pregnant somehow overrule the data that says it’s 99.9% effective/my nurse saying she wouldn’t even do a test on me if I came in with nexplanon claiming to be pregnant. 

I’ve just started CBT and I’m on anti-depressants (citalopram, which I don’t think is working after 5 weeks on 10mg). I’m just terrified that I’ll never get better, and I’ll have to leave my university and my boyfriend and friends in London and move home to my parents again (who I adore, but I never wanted to stay at home for uni. That would be a massive defeat for me).

Just needed to vent because I’m fkin terrified right now and all I can thing about is the pain I’m getting in my stomach, and if it’s a baby kicking me.

If they were looking for like some sort of bowel thing, would they have missed something like colon cancer or something serious? Does an MRI even detect stuff like that?

The problem is my stomach still will NOT stop. It's acting up immensely. I've gotten over a lot of my health anxiety, to the point where I've been off meds but I had to take a pill today to relax.

 I was diagnosed with Illness Anxiety Disorder two years ago and I generally have a pretty good hold of it. Yesterday, I was showering and a drop or two or water got into one nostril in my nose.

However, I live in Florida, and I'm really paranoid that the brain eating amoeba is lurking in the water.

So this is a little difficult to explain, so hopefully I can describe it as cohesively as possible. So, a couple months ago I developed a little obsession with misreading things. I misread a couple of words and immediately began to think “there is something wrong with my brain”. Well now, it’s manifested itself in just about everything. In a bizarre way to prove I do/don’t have a problem, I’ve begun subconsciously “checking” every thing I read and hear to see if I made a mistake. For instance, I’ll skim a headline really fast online, then get frustrated when I misread it (even though I didn’t carefully read it). Because I’m now “checking” every single word I read and hear, I’m constantly misreading, mishearing and misunderstanding things, because I’m focusing on each individual word and not the sentence as a whole. It’s mentally exhausting and is effecting my reasoning skills and memory, which of course, is fueling my health anxiety as it further “proves” I have something wrong with me. 

Of course, occupying my mind with this causes me to make many, many mistakes which- you guessed it- fuels it more.

So I’ve been suffering from health anxiety for about 4 years now. It all started with a donkey biting my arm while on vacation. Since then, I’ve had the rabies shots twice. I go to my doctor many times a year. I’ve developed a chronic pain on my shoulder. And I pretty much freak out over every little symptom.

Last night my mom called me to tell me she was coming down with a cold. I remembered that yesterday I borrowed her scarf and used it all day. Wanting to prevent a cold, I crushed a raw garlic clove and ate it. I’ve done this before many times and normally it just gives me a little acid reflux. I’ve noticed that raw garlic keeps me pretty healthy overall. However, this time, I developed a burning sensation in my throat about fives minutes after I ate it. It has now been burning me for about 6 hours. I woke up in the middle of the night and have not been able to go back to sleep. I had some milk and a banana and took ibuprofen to see if it would help the pain/burning sensation. Even my chest started hurting, which never usually happens to me. 

I’m embarrassed to go to the hospital for just a stupid raw garlic but my mind is going there and I’m already catastrophizing everything (ie I’ve burned a hole through my throat, this will somehow lead to death, etc). I’m hoping the symptoms  go down within the next couple of hours, otherwise, the pain will get the better of me and I might actually go to the emergency room.

In times like these I hate myself and how miserable I make life for myself. Why can’t I just get over these dumb fears? If I wasn’t so afraid all the time, I wouldn’t have eaten the garlic. My anxiety and negative thinking is probably making my pain and symptoms worse (I’m an expert at that).

I have no job right now and I wasn't going to school, so I spent most of the summer inside, to an unhealthy extent. When I did go out for long enough, I developed a rash that I think is PMLE, which is a mild allergy to sunlight, not fun but harmless. Then I saw that it can be a symptom of HIV infection. Granted, I've never had this reaction before. The page said it can develop around my age, and near-nonexistent sun exposure mixed with periods of high exposure can probably cause reactions like that, especially since it was a pretty brutal summer, but I'm still terrified.

Around this time I also started to develop these purplish vein-like patterns on my legs, and that just made me panic even more because I couldn't just explain that away.

healthanxiety,ratlizardmutantgirl,2018/01/22,"Really bad health anxiety at night Some background... I was diagnosed with OCD in the third grade, but was suspected of having it long before that. I have bad intrusive thoughts. I've been in and out of therapy for many years. 

Within the past few years my health anxiety has gotten bad again, like it was when I was a child. In late 2016, when I was 19, I went through a phase where I thought I was dying Every. Single. Night. I ended up having so many panic attacks and losing a lot of friends. I lost over 60 pounds in like 2-3 months. I got into a relationship on the tail end of this breakdown and am still with my partner. It helped a lot and continues to help.

Now, like a year and a half later, it's not as bad as it was in that period, but the symptoms linger still. I haven't had a checkup since a little before the breakdown in 2016. I'll go to the doctor if I catch a cold or whatever but not for a checkup.

Now....this is because I'm like, terrified that I'll find out that I have a terminal illness. Cancer, of any type, kidney failure, some kind of disease... whatever, it doesn't matter. Whenever I think about it I freak out and get nauseous and scared. When I'm laying in bed at night I will feel my boobs for lumps, and always convince myself something is there when it isn't, in different parts of my boobs. I've gotten to a point where I dont even like touching them. 

I know it would be better to just find out and get to fix it asap, but it scares me so bad I'm afraid it would just ruin my will to live. :( I'm not currently in therapy but I know i need to be.

It's the worst at night when my boyfriend is asleep, but it's seeping over into my daily life. If my biology prof starts talking about cancer my thoughts just spiral out of control making me think I have it. It's gotten so bad that I actually have anxiety about the anxiety itself. :(

healthanxiety,OriginalUsername1,2018/01/24,"Just venting a bit... Hello guys. 

For the past month or so I’ve been dealing with daily stress from thinking I have something. It started out with weakness and fatigue and stomach and stool issues which I attributed to colorectal cancer. After multiple blood tests and ct scans that found nothing, I made the mistake of looking up my symptoms on doctor google and found als. Ever since (this was early Jan) I’ve been over analyzing every “symptom” I have and haven’t had real peace of mind. It’s taken a huge toll on me mentally and I plan to get help. I’m the last 3 weeks I’ve gone from having twitches all over to burning in my arms to twitching in my hand and now what looks like atrophy in my thenar muscles. I am scared and I just wanted to get it off my chest since my neuro referral won’t come for like another month.

Things I have going for me:

1: I am a 23 year old Hispanic male and statistically less probable to get the disease
2: my twitches are widespread, which is uncommon in als. Only recently have they been in my right hand more focused.
3: the “lack of strength” I originally felt isn’t there anymore, nor am I dropping things or have any strength loss that I can see
4: I have gotten back into the gym and can lift things comfortably and well. 
5: no family history of neuro diseases
6: this has been going on for a month without affecting my life (other than mentally)

Things I worry about:

1: My right hand palm has some visible dents and lines that I feel have gotten more pronounced. This has not resulted in weakness but they seem to have gotten worse. I’ve googled a lot of pictures and compared to friends and family and I havent found any that look like mine. All I’ve found are clearly atrophied which at that point is completely obvious and don’t look like mine. Mine look as though I’m missing muscle strips and crevices.

2: on the same right hand, the thenar muscles have begun twitching as of 5 days ago. My index finger especially will twitch and jump on its own. Also my right thumb/hand is less flexible than my left.

healthanxiety,coordinatedflight,2018/01/25,"Ex-Smoker, Fear, and Excessive Research Hi everyone.

As a health anxiety sufferer, I have an interesting story to share.

A few years ago, I picked up a habit of smoking hookah. I smoked cigars for a bit as well, throughout the same period.

I smoked hookah probably between 100 and 200 times in all.

Once I left my masters program, a few years later I felt a pain in my back. This was my first bout with health anxiety. I couldn't figure out what was causing it, so Googling symptoms led me to lung cancer.

I thought, ""I smoked, so it could be true."" Then I saw this awful number online: Hookah = 100 Cigarettes, according to various news organizations, citing the WHO.

This terrified me. I smoked the equivalent of FIVE PACKS every time I smoked?!

Of course, eventually I found out that lung cancer was not the case. It was a messed up nerve. Physical therapy and some posture fixes, and that particular back pain is more under control. (I also have chronic back pain, I believe as a result of anxiety and a lack of movement.)

Fast forward a few years.

At the beginning of this year, I started having a high level of health anxiety after visiting the dermatologist and having some moles removed. (They were dysplastic nevuses - he removed them, but honestly probably didn't even need to.)

I started freaking out about melanoma, but when I realized I could relatively well see and manage that if it were to happen, as long as I stay vigilant about skin checks and doc checkups, melanoma is not a big threat.

But then the lung cancer scare came back.

I frantically tried to understand how much damage had I done. Pack years - how many do I have? 1? 5? 10?

I've read probably 100 different studies, done a thousand google searches, to understand the connection between hookah smoking and lung cancer.

Long story short, this led me down a path of compulsively studying. I also went back and reconstructed my year of smoking - down to the day-by-day level. I've requested transaction logs from my bank to see when I was in a particular place - when COULD I have smoked?

Some of this was actually helpful. I narrowed down my smoking to a possible 215 days, many of which I likely didn't smoke anyway. So I shrunk that fear a bit by looking at the reality.

Some of the other research I did was helpful, too - looking into the claim of 100-cigarette equivalence revealed that the number stated is referring to the volume of smoke, not necessarily the equivalence of hazard. I can't take a solid guess as to a better number, but the research I've read looks like much less than 100 for an average session.

Lastly, a lot of this research was NOT helpful, as my interpretation of the research caused me to catastrophize it.

My setup is a perfect example of what would drive a health anxiety sufferer insane: Reason to believe that something bad could happen (my short-lived smoking habit), ambiguity on the risk (very little research on hookah and its impact on your health), lots of scary media surrounding smoking, and finally my dodgy memory of how often and how much I smoked during that year.

This is a perfect recipe for fear for a health anxiety sufferer.

My wife and I had our first son last year. All of this fear has grown into a tragic story where my son loses his father at a young age because his father smoked hookah for a year. This all sounds silly from the outside, but completely plausible from the inside.

I want to encourage health anxiety sufferers who have analytical brains like me: focus on what is in front of you today. There is nothing you can do to change what happened yesterday. Be aware, but don't ruminate. Look for actions you can take today to be healthy, not reasons why you aren't healthy.

I'm learning that no matter what risk levels I have, there is nothing I can do to nail that down perfectly, and trying to nail it down keeps rumination and negative thoughts constantly in my head. The what-if questions stay present. The hyperfocusing on what my shortened life would look like - that pervades my mental state.

Now, today, is the day where I look at what I have and say ""thank you"" for it. Look at my past, and accept it. Look at my risk, and accept it. Look at the future with belief and hope for the best, rather than constantly fearing the worst.",5.79182916892993,7.2879269252218,6.22142472388195,75.5526259505704,67.4537389100127,9.43799565453558,31.8332654354518

I’ve never seen a doctor specifically for it because it has never really gotten in the way of my life, just occasionally my head. Anyway, I’ve been experiencing some mild night sweats the past couple days. I wake up an hour or two after going to sleep and my shirt is generally damp. It’s not enough sweating to change sheets or anything, but sometimes I have to remove my shirt. I’ve had on and off night sweats in the past that freaked me out, such as last winter when I almost convinced myself I had some type of cancer because, well, a quick search on google led me to Mayo Clinic and... I think you can get the rest (this might have been a good time to see a doctor about anxiety...). Also, I had some mild night sweats for a while last month, but after I returned home from college they miraculously stopped. Last night was particularly bad in that my shirt was definitely soaked when I woke up in the middle of the night, but I just took it off and after stressing over it for a couple minutes, got myself to go back to sleep, and woke up with no more sweat. I should emphasize that when I really wake up, like in the morning, I do not wake up sweating.

healthanxiety,lapointypartyhat,2018/01/26,"I feel like my psychologist might be ready to refer me elsewhere I have OCD with a health anxiety emphasis. My worries have run the gamut but I mostly focus on the idea of skin cancer. I have been seeing a psychologist for CBT and while in the sessions everything he says sounds logical and makes perfect sense. However, the second I encounter a mole I feel looks suspicious I don't apply what I've learned in therapy and I do everything wrong. I start by googling my symptoms and then when that doesn't work, I go to my doctor to seek reassurance. This assuages my fears temporarily but sometimes its not enough until the doctor will agree to a biopsy. Then inevitably the cycle continues.

My psychologist has been doing this therapy with me for months and I was doing so well until I tried testing myself and found a new mole. I was definitely not ready for it and this started a downward spiral where I feel like all the progress I made went by the wayside and I was back to how I was in the beginning.

Today I had a session after my most recent urgent care &amp; doctor visit. The tone was a lot different this time and I can tell he's frustrated with me because I am not using his advice. He kept saying, ""I am sorry that I haven't been able to get through to you to help you."" and has pointed out that I am not doing the work of not giving into my compulsions. He said that he didn't want to make me go through therapy if I wasn't motivated to do the work to get better. He's totally right. 


The positive that came out of this is that I am reflecting on my lack of motivation to do what I know I need to do to get better.

healthanxiety,katt_kem,2018/01/27,"My HIV hypochondria is acting up again 😐 Hey guys,
So I had been sleeping with this guy (Rob) on and off since 2016 and around August last year I started to get anxious about his status after stalking his exes facebook. I noticed she had cold sores on her lips and the last time I saw her in 2015 I saw her with cold sores. At first I thought it was normal because lots of people have and get cold sores but when I saw a recent picture of her on Facebook with the same if not worse cold sores. This concerned me because to my knowledge only people who are immuno compromised get recurring cold sores that often. 
I had spoken to Rob about his status earlier and he assured me he was healthy and I chose to believe him but after speaking to one of my girl friends she was surprised at how quick I was to believe him. She said verbatim ""guys can lie and I don't trust these uni boys"" - keep in mind I live in Kenya where HIV is prevalent. This comment really freaked me out and I was sure he lied to me. 
I started freaking out and going crazy because of the picture of his ex coupled with my friend's comments, I was sure I had contracted the virus. At this time I started sending him cryptic messages alluding to him infecting me but he didn't get which then forced me to plainly ask ""Are you HIV positive?"" He quickly replied ""No I'm not. I checked, you also checked"" and I went and got tested and my results returned negative (this wasn't a rapid test it was the one you wait two days for). 
I felt so bad about accusing him and we stopped speaking. 
Skip forward 3 months and we start fucking again. We met up and fucked 2 more times before I officially ended it for good. Now my mind is going back to thoughts that I'm HIV positive again. I keep thinking that maybe the first 6 times we met up and fucked the virus missed me and on the last 7th and 8th time the virus may have stuck. Is that possible?

healthanxiety,DistinctWhereas,2018/01/27,"Is it normal to get screened for psychosis even though I dont have any symptoms of it??? Ok, let me explain what is going on. Hope some of you can relate to this. My anxiety is through the roof.

Couple of years back I had stress-induced panic anxiety, with all the classic symptoms (rapid heartbeat, crazy tensions, panic attacks, fatique etc.). My doctor had a hard time telling me what was going on, and I kept coming to the worst conclusions -&gt; this gave me some crazy health anxiety and the fear of dying. I came over this in a year, and haven't had any of this for 2 years straight.

Now, 4 months ago I start to feel a little depressed, nothing major, I assumed it was due to the winter coming, messed up sleeping pattern and life just being a bit boring. This threw me right back into the health anxiety. Thoughts racing constantly about why I got depressed, what is happening to me, am I going crazy etc. I went to the doctor, saying that I felt off, a bit emotionally numb, and racing thoughts 24/7. I took a depression test there, but kinda showed nothing, so the doctor kept asking me questions about hallucinations and delusions, which I have had nothing of, never. I went back a couple of more times assuming something physical was wrong with me or atleast something crazy that messed with my cognitive abilities. Got the same questions again and again.

So I slowly started thinking about the questions, what if I am gonna hallucinate, see stuff that isnt there etc. Now I am stuck here with some 24/7 dp/dr, constant hyperawareness and crazy anxiety about hallucinating or going psychotic or something. It's like my brain is in super defence mode, recognizing everything that changes in my surroundings, telling me to reality check everything so I am sure that I am not going crazy. I feel so off.

I went to my doctor again and told her about the fear of going crazy or developing schizophrenia. And she sent me to a psyciatrist, with the reference of me being psychotic. When I read the reference I had a fullblown panic attack, I just froze. This made my anxiety 100x worse than before, thinking that I must be super crazy.

Recently I went to the psyciatrist who asked me the same questions about delusions and halluciations, and I described again the same things. That I've never had them, never had any delusions. But I am starting to think whenever I see something, delusional thoughts pop up in my head, because of my obsession about the fear: ""what if I thought someone were actually following me"" etc.. all kinds of intruisive thoughts that I know for a fact that is no were near real, but just scary that that they pop up in my head all the damn time. I used some metaphors there at the interview and I think she might have gotten the totally wrong idea of what I told her. Because now I am being sent off to an interview about schizophrenia and psychosis, because she thinks I am that apparently, even though I don't have any symptoms at all. She even gave me a temporary diagnosis as a schizophrenic wtf.

This is throwing me off, what the f is happening. Am I losing control, I can't believe this is happening. Is this normal to get screened for??? I feel so detatched right now, stuck in full blown overanalyzing mode of my surroundings, I can't relax. What if I am going schizophrenic or psycotic????

I've always suffered from severe anxiety, particularly health anxiety, and depression(to less of an extent), I remember at 12 the fear of testicular cancer just plaguing my every thought for months because of a dull ache in my testes.

Anyway, just before i started university for the first time a friend died of brain cancer, and all of my close friends' moms died of breast cancer when I was young, so I have a warped perception of how common it is, I guess. Aside from this my life has been filled with death, my father is terminally Ill, my mum was suicidal and almost died of blood poisoning, my grandma had vascular dementia and we cared for her at home until her death, more beyond this, grandparents, friends' parents, uncles and aunts.

My anxiety since starting uni has worsened, I suffer an elevated heart rate and sweats 24/7, extreme worrying thoughts all the time, trembling hands, especially bad at night. 

I've not had any memory issues or coordination issues, it's literally just headaches, for the past few weeks I've been getting pain in very singular spots, never a full over generalised headache, it lasts for a few seconds to a minute and then disappears, and this happens a few times through the day. 
The kicker is if I CAN remove myself from my anxiety it doesn't really happen, I was shopping all of yesterday with my girlfriend and didnt have any issues at all until we got into a quiet taxi, at which point my thoughts went rampant.

I just feel like my anxiety is killing me, and it's really spearheaded into this fear of a tumor. I sleep awfully too because of my anxiety and grind my teeth severely, as well as holding my shoulders up and tight all the time. 

EVERY rational part of me says it's all a mental thing, but I cannot get that rational part of my brain to win over, I'm in constant states of terror and get these huge adrenaline rushes physically crashing over me daily.

Should I see a doctor? Should I be hugely worried from the point of view of a Tumour?

healthanxiety,Herman-Toothrot,2018/01/28,"Wheezing / constricted airways after exercising in the cold I've been doing the Couch-to-5K running program for about a month.  It's been in the 40s and 50s a lot lately when I go running.  I'm able to complete my runs fine, but I notice after getting home that the deepest parts of my lungs feel tight or constricted.  I can force a deep breath, but when I do I hear this wheezing like the airways are stretching back open.  Usually after about 30 - 60 min or so it's back to normal.

I tried wearing a neck gaiter after the first time and it got a lot better, but was still there.  I went to the doctor and described all this and he listened to my lungs.  He said my lungs sounded perfect.  And that it's normal to have that wheezing after exercising in the cold, since your airways constrict and forcing them open creates a spasm that makes that wheezing sound.  He also said as long as it's only that and not actual shortness of breath, then it's nothing to worry about and to continue running (preferably when it stops being cold).

It is an irrational thing at this point, since I've been to the doctor and described exactly what was going on to him.  Knowing the way my anxiety works, I suspect the reasons I haven't dropped it are that he didn't hear it actually doing it (and to me it sounds strange) and that I secretly worry it's a small start to a bigger lung issue (I've had a couple relatives pass away after getting pulmonary fibrosis - which definitely is in my head when anything lung-related is going on).  Any tips or other support would be fantastic!

PS - I refuse to google it (or anything else for that matter) but if anyone has support for pulmonary fibrosis worries that would help too.  I believe for my relatives that started with gradually dropping oxygen levels and some strange sounds the doctors could hear in their breathing.  So nothing like what I'm describing here .. if only health anxiety used the rational side of the brain!",6.74086393331832,7.12855100259068,6.85159044829917,75.8317402568146,64.880829015544,9.20009011038522,35.1763910790719

The anxiety comes in waves and is usually when I am on my own and not keeping myself busy. The symptoms are so raw and debilitating that I sometimes genuinely think I have a undiagnosed heart condition. Common symptoms include the following:

- Floating/sinking chest feeling

- Sudden twinges and sharp pierces that go after 1/2 seconds 

- Increase in heart rate

- Cold shivers 

- Restlessness (have to get up and walk around)

- Panic attacks

- Strange tingling an aching that is always on the left side of chest and resonates to left arm  and shoulder blade

- Dizziness/lightheadednesss

More often than not, this gives miraculous results and I feel fantastic after every run. Occasionally however, the anxiety kicks in half way through the run and it is a real struggle to continue.

I stopped smoking weed a couple days ago to see if it would help. Anyways,  In the beginning of last week she was admitted to the hospital and, among other things, it really stressed me out.

I've also googled burning skin and anxiety can cause that but it still hasn't really made me feel better. I had some blood work done and she prescribed me muscle relaxers and an antidepressant and told me to come back in 3 weeks. Could all my symptoms really just be from anxiety?

healthanxiety,darkandtwisty_,2018/01/31,"Struggling with fear of breast cancer after seeing multiple doctors. Feeling lost. Hello everyone! This sub has been a great source of comfort for me for quite some time now. I have never felt the need to post until today as the last month has been very hard on me and I'm hoping someone will have some ideas on how I can combat my extreme health anxiety.

As a preface, I’m a 24 year old woman.

About a month ago, I felt a giant white welt under my left breast. The next day, it was no longer raised completely, but there was a slight bump like a pimple or a bug bite, but there was no 'peak'. It was red in the area, about the size of a quarter. No pain, no itching. I don't think I would have noticed it if I hadn't felt it. I have always struggled with health anxiety but for the past 6 months it has been pretty dormant. Then I googled 'bug bite on breast' and everything spiraled from there.

I stumbled upon Inflammatory Breast Cancer and am now convinced that I have it. I read multiple stories about how it is commonly misdiagnosed as a bug-bite (my doctor said it was a bug bite when I went in). This made my anxiety worse. So I saw another doctor at the family practice I go to. She wasn't sure what it was, it could be a pimple/skin irritation, and told me if it was still there in 2 weeks she would send me to a breast specialist.

I made an appointment with a breast specialist on my own because I could not bear the wait. He looked at it and told me it is most likely just a skin irritation from my bra or a clogged pore that is taking a while to heal. Said if it didn't go away in another 2-3 weeks that he would send me for an ultrasound but he really didn’t think it was anything to worry about.

Again, this was not enough for me. I made an appointment with my OBGYN and he looked at it and echoed the same sentiment the other doctors did. It is nothing, whatever it was is on its way to healing. But he would send me for an ultrasound to set my mind at ease.

I got the ultrasound yesterday and they didn’t find anything. They said there is a chance it was a tiny cyst that is now almost gone that it is undetectable on the machine. This should have made me feel better but I read online that IBC is very hard to detect on ultrasounds. If it didn’t go away in two weeks, the radiologist told me I should see a dermatologist because it seems to be more of a skin issue. 

That day, I called to make an appointment with a derm because I know it takes time to get in to see them. Funnily enough, they had a cancellation that day and asked if I wanted to come in that afternoon. Of course, I said yes. 

When I was there, I explained my issues. The derm looked at it and again, said the same thing everyone else did. It’s most likely just a skin irritation and she gave me the option of waiting to see if it goes away on its own within 2-3 months or she could do a shave biopsy. I, of course, opted for the biopsy.

Then I got home and did more research and found out IBC is usually only diagnosed through a punch biopsy. The biopsy I got at the derm will not be deep enough to diagnose that even if it is there.

I cannot catch my breath and am struggling to function like a normal human being. It’s much more likely that the spot under my breast is just what everyone says it is; an irritation!!! IBC is SO rare, especially for someone my age, but it’s the deadliness of the disease that is haunting my every move. I am so terrified of death and of dying young and leaving behind everyone I love.

I am on 10mg Buspar and have been for only a month now. The side effects are crippling me. I am only sleeping 3-4 hours a night, I’m having horrible nightmares, dizziness, headaches. I am not eating and have lost 15 pounds this month because of it. I cry hysterically almost every night. I obsessively check my boobs, whether that is starting at them in the mirror or prodding them or comparing them (the left one is bigger than the right, always has been – but my health anxiety makes me wonder if it really has always been this way).

Every new spot I discover or mark or freckle sends me into extreme panic. I’m struggling to meet deadlines at work. I’m letting my house go to shit. 


 I just started therapy last week so I am hoping that eventually starts to kick in and help as well.

I guess what I’m looking for is advice on how to calm my nerves. How to function like a normal human being. I’m so depressed. I’m missing out on so much. 

Any words of advice would be so appreciated.

healthanxiety,nathan98900,2018/02/02,"Think Before You Post: why reassurance seeking might be feeding your health anxiety. Hey /r/healthanxiety, 

Just thought I'd make a post detailing my personal experience and knowledge about reassurance seeking and why it is self destructive. 

So, you're experiencing your symptom that you're increasingly more worried about. Whether that be chest pains, heart palpitations, stomach problems, poop problems, any of the hundreds of symptoms any of us could possibly be worried about. 

You're worried about if this is the time where your worrying is justified, or if it is actually a sign of the illness you're fearing.

Maybe you've already been to the doctor to get checked out, but doubt their opinion.

All of these have happened to me, and happen to many many other HA sufferers, which is completely okay. 

**However**, the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery.

Usually, what I would do, is post here, explaining my symptoms and what I was worried it was. Then I'd get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit. Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.

All of this felt like what I had to do, a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine. 

In the short term, yes, it made me feel better but this was only short lived.

This might also account for medical tests, I've spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT, colonoscopy or endoscopy, or whatever it might be, would make all their worries go away. Which, after the short term relief, the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety; I speak from experience.

One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.

So, if you don't seek that reassurance, what's going to happen? For me, at first, it was unbareable anxiety, and just an extreme desire to check I was okay, whether that was through posting to the subreddit, the discord, asking family, checking my body for lumps, checking my lymph nodes etc. 

You'll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want, which is completely okay. Rather than seeking reassurance, do something mindful, something genuinely healthy for the mind. As, when in a very high anxiety situation, sometimes it's the things that you do during that time that really define how your mental wellbeing will go in the future. 

You can do many things, for me, it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else, not an easy task by any means, but something to try. After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry, which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance. 

You could possibly try meditation, though, if you don't regularly practice it, it'll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels. 

You could try relaxing music, your favourite food, anything else that enhances your mood, whatever works for you. 

During this time, you will experience anxiety, potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance, but I promise you, in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem.

When you seek reassurance, you're reinforcing the behaviours which keep your health anxiety alive unfortunately, because usually it feels like the right thing, and the only thing to do in that situation. But trust me, try not seeking it.

It'll be very similar to [this graph](https://thegirlwiththecurlyhair.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/anxiety-repeated-exposure-graph.png), the more you do it the easier it'll be. And it might get to the point where the anxiety almost completely goes after a while of practicing this.

healthanxiety,TyroneYuFresh,2018/02/02,"Loss of appetite for over a month I believe I got the flu right on Christmas Day, most likely caused by eating extremely spicy popcorn which I have been eating somewhat frequently prior. Went to the ER about 4 days after and got nothing but laughs from the doctor saying there's nothing wrong. Been eating nothing but rice porridge and shredded pork for over a week. I could hold food down but have completely lost the urge to eat since, would occasionally eat out to try and care for my hunger pangs that I think I was having. At first it was difficult to eat or even will myself to eat, got better, then got worse again. At this point, I could hardly eat and have to seriously think about whether or not I am hungry since it's seemingly impossible to tell when it was as easy as a stomach growl before then. 5-6 days ago, I think I got food poisoning, now I absolutely can't eat anything. Got the flu shot maybe 2 days prior and things only seemed to get worse then. Would often puke but wouldn't see food come back out, mostly what looked like saliva (had nothing but rice porridge after all). Went to the doctor's office and was prescribed Ranitidine, the medication may have cause this sense of looming nervousness but it's most likely just me since I've been fine with it every other time after about the second day of taking it or so. Decided that it was now necessary to force feed myself to jumpstart my appetite along with light walking (1-2 miles after each meal or so, I wasn't physically active at all prior, worse since I was bedridden during the flu). I fear that I'm overeating when I've been told to eat 5-6 small meals each day, I've also grown terribly impatient with my recovery seeing as how this has been going on for over a month. I would often feel incredibly miserable and every day I was plagued with anxiety until I decided to force feed myself, I don't care about getting fat anymore, I just want my appetite back, but now I'm starting to fear that I'm going about this the wrong way. The feelings of hopelessness and anxiety have hardly gotten better and while I don't suspect my loss of appetite is due to my anxiety, I can never be too sure. The whole reason why I even had anxiety in the first place was because of how sudden my loss of appetite was, and how I was unable to self diagnose myself since I felt no abdominal pain whatsoever, I'm at a loss as to what's going on with my body.

Ok i've made posts about things I've felt before but somehow everything I had 2 weeks ago is now gone and has been replaced by new fears.

I'll get straight to it, here are symptoms with context:

- Odd feeling on left side of body, mainly legs, only when laying or sitting. Feels like weakness but I can still walk just fine and feel no difference in balance. Sort of like fatigue without any actual excercise to cause it, really odd and it scares me.

- Tinnitus, already diagnosed 2 years ago with bilateral tinnitus and it's got easier to deal with. But in times like these it makes me feel awful. I'm aware of the recent progresses in Tinnitus treatment so it doesn't worry me too much as it's benign and only sounds when i'm in silence.

- Constipation, probably caused by the stress or anxiety. Either way it might be causing me problems.

- Intermittent sharp stomach pains on the left side of my abdomen under ribs, I called the doctor about it and he said it was nothing lethal or worrying but to get it checked out anyway. That my current worst fear, that I had a digestive infection caused by the constipation. 

- A feeling that for some reason, I'm going to die tomorrow from some lethal random attack of sorts, like my intestines will rupture from a tiny stomach pain, or that I'll have a heart attack because I can sometimes hear pounding in my head. That's the worst of all of this, the never being able to relax, I feel on edge 24/7. Researching everything that I can in order to reassure myself, only to find an even worse disease that vaguely correlates to my symptoms.

I always feel the urge to check my speech to see if it's slurred, or check my heartrate to check for palpitations, or check my typing to check for stroke/ALS. I seriously can't keep living like this, why do I keep getting these physical symptoms?!

healthanxiety,wafflemanfuzz,2018/02/04,"HIV worry Hi there,

About a month ago I had unprotected sex with my ex girlfriend (we have still maintained a close friendship). She told me she had been tested for STDs since the last time she had sex, I had had blood work and urine work done since the last time I had had sex also. About a week later she told me she had missed her period and we were worried about pregnancy. She was sick for a few days, nauseous and fatigued. After a while she got better but during that time I asked if she had blood work done, to which she replied no, just urine. She thought the same negative thoughts as me (she also has health anxiety). 

When she got better she assured me that she had just been stressed, not eating right and I had nothing to worry about. She even called me to reassure me.

Now I am studying abroad in the Middle East, and I started feeling sick last week. I had a stomach ache (normal for new bacteria in food) and then a sore throat and congestion. Instantly I thought this was the worst and that I had HIV. Again I told her I was freaking out but she reassured me that I was fine and so was she. I found out that my friend in the program has had the same symptoms  as me and we guessed it was allergies.

Now I’ve been taking antihistamines and feel better but the thought won’t leave my mind. I understand that it’s very hard to get anything through vaginal intercourse, plus I am circumcised (0.08% that she has it, 0.04% chance that I could get it from her if she was +). It’s hard to get tested in the country I’m in because that’s simply how it is. I’ve asked her to get tested but she said she’s been very busy and she told me I need to get help for my anxiety. I made an appointment with a psychiatrist because I have a history of panicking and anxiety.

healthanxiety,HypoTomasis,2018/02/06,"Heart anxiety pvc, vt and cpvt Hi there. I want to begin to tell you that I have suffer from health anxiety for few years. I was actually good for 3 years until 10 weeks ago. 

Last two years I've had skipped beats. Doctor told me it was probably pvc and did no test. I believed him and continued with my life. These skipped beats would happened when in rest so I wasn't worried. Last year I had a hernia surgery and I couldn't run for 4 month's. Then last summer I noticed when I started running that my heart would skip beats or flutter more frequently during excersice. Sometimes just 1-2 times but sometimes 10 times. 

I saw a cardiologist and he did ECG, echo, stress test. My heart is structurally normal and everything looks fine except 1 pvc during stress test. 

I didn't have any anxiety and continue working out. Than 10 weeks ago I was running. I'm not in good shape because I'm scared of exercising. Everything went fine until I had pvc. I continued running and got few in a row! my heart started pumping and I felt numbness and my heart was getting pvc A LOT. I thought I was going to faint but I didn't. My friend called the ambulance. I freaked out When they came my pvc had stop and I just had 150 bpm. ECG showed nothing. Had a blood test as we'll and 2 more ECG which showed nothing. Docs told me nothing to worry about. 

I was fine until week ago when I was watching tv and relaxing. I noticed chest tingling. I took my pulse and it was fast. I had a panic attack and skipped beats, few in a row. I called a ambulance and they did ECG 2x and there we're no sign of anything. My skipped beats were not happening when they came. 

I had a holter and I'm waiting for the results but it only captured skip bear  while at rest. I'm trying to get on with my life but I can't take this anymore. I'm so anxious. Deep down in my heart I worry so much that I have Venticular tachardia because of those skipped beats while excsersising or panic attacks. They came more than 3 in a row and that is suppose to be a bad sign. I want to believe my doctors but I can't get it out of my head that they have never capatured my heart fast and inregular at the same time. Only pvc or fast sinus rate. 

I'm can't sleep I can't enjoy anything and I'm have been a mess last week's because of this Venticular tachardia anxiety. 

summary. I've experience at least two times fast rate and skipped beats. It also happened one time when I had adrenaline rush because of a bad family fight. My heart started skipping beats alot and sometimes even during dramatic sport events my heart races with skipped beats. It happens if I have adrenaline, if I'm excsersising and panic attacks and stress.Also sometimes when drinking alcohol 

I'm 24 year old 90 kg 185 cm never smoked have panic attacks and health anxiety. 

Should I worry that they have never capture my heart going fast and skipping beats? Any advice? be honest.
I had few good weeks with my anxiety but then googled some shit and found CPVT and it's giving me one helluva anxiety.

Im just playing everything in my head. I get more skipped beats when my heart is racing curing excersice or panic.
I have had ECG when it happened but my pvc had stopped already and it only showed sinus tachardia.

I just want to stop think about this. Deep down I know I'm 99% all right but my brain keeps getting what if especially with cpvt fear.

healthanxiety,inaverylonelyplace,2018/02/06,"Pretty bad anxiety towards taking meds with a possibility to prolong QT. Help. [Warning: this post got much, MUCH longe r than I anticipated. Sorry to however actually reads this entire essay.]

So, I have a psychiatrist who recently prescribed me sertraline (for chronic depression/ptsd) and trazodone (for sleep) but I actually haven't taken either. This specific phobia started like 1-1 1/2 yrs ago I think. I had walking pneumonia a few weeks ago and absolutely had to take antibiotics and Holy shit, my anxiety was thru the roof every time I was time to take it.  I was absolutely convinced my QT interval was significantly prolonged and I was going to die in my sleep! I feel like I narrowly escaped death after I finished the course. Which is ridiculous.

I have had ekgs countless times, probably like over 10 times (ftr I'm only 18 and only started getting them in the last two years) and for the most part, were completely 100% normal (shocker).... excluding this one time during my purging like 3x a day and keeping literally nothing down phase where my hearts repolarization phase fucked beyond belief.

Actually I'm just going to talk about that a little because the anxiety still plagues me. my heart was physically rattling / shaking in my chest with every beat, like it was unsure of how to beat normally. it was incredibly scary, I think I experienced what I believe was possibly a very brief arrhythmia. at first I thought it may have been a minor seizure (which wouldn't be that unrealistic, as purging (electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia.), sleep deprivation (I had stayed up all night), physical activity while literally running on empty (we were inside playing basketball when it all started) and of course hypoglycemia (essentially not-eating will do that to ya) all lower the seizure threshold, and also how i might have had a seizure once back when I was abusing dxm constantly which of course predisposes you to future seizures) because of how disoriented I got and how everything became slow motion, almost similar to the time distortion one would get on a psychedelic.

......but that didn't explain how my heart rate was reaching 140 (for the record, throughout the last 2ish years that I have been measuring it, it has always, always sat at a comfy 55-60 while not using HR-raising drugs such as dxm or speed) when I got it taken in the nurses office in the psychiatric facility, and how I felt like I was about to die. When I went and got that ekg I believe actually traumatized me in a way. 

Coming fairly close to death (which has actually happened to me a numerous times,  with my purging phase, over exercising phase (I actually kept a fucking exercise bike in my tiny ass room and legit would use it non stop for 3-5 hours to burn off literally everything I ate and then some, feeling proud when my net calories for the day ended up in the negative. it was bad, real bad) restriction phase (I have eaten less than 500 calories / day for months at a time, several times, in fact I can feel a restriction phase coming on, as I am pushing myself to not eat, God I hate being eating disordered, but st this point it's a safety blanket after I've been dealing with this shit day n day out since 13 yrs old me first decided to eat like 100 calories a day for 2 or 3 months (can't rmmbr) cos I was obese. Cant really remember if I started out with disordered thinking and intentions, or if it just was a crash diet-turned weird obsession and addiction to weight loss. and also, this one non eating disorder related time I was riding in a car with my mom maybe 1 1/2 years ago , legit almost got tboned (we would have been hit on my/her side of the car, had we been just 2 seconds slower getting through the intersection, that person would have hit us. oddly enough, she was panicking, yet I f elt absolutely nothing, no adrenaline, no fear, nothing. I attribute that to how I learned to dissociate from everything at. A young age due to my father's husband abusing us constantly (lol dissociation as a coping mechanism is cool (not))

I wholeheartedly believe I could have died if I continued with the purging (I still get extreme anxiety when I analyze that specific ekg I know I should throw it out but I just can't, I am a person who is very much into record keeping). I feel like I am not actually alive, that I died months / years ago, and this is maybe purgatory. I alternate between genuinely feeling like I should truly not be / am not actually alive, because of all of this shit. Not sure if that's connected to the ptsd or what. I mean, I was dxd with major depressive disorder with psychotic features, at one point. God my life is a nightmare. I so desperately wish to take the place of a normal person Ie didn't have an abusive biological father, isn't a piece of shit drug addict, doesn't harm themselves via eating habits and excessive exercise, doesn't have all these stupid ridiculous mental things. (how did my life end up like this.......) I fantasize about it alot. Normal people with normal lives take that shit for granted. It angers me. They just don't understand how goddamn lucky they fucking are, Holy fucking shit. 

(Oops, sorry for the going off on a total tangent. That happens to me sometimes.)

Anyway...How do I get over this.... I honestly would not take any med like that on a daily basis unless I had an at home ekg that I could use like 12 times a day. Actually, every time I discontinued an Ssri or antipsychotic it as because I could ""sense"" that my QT interval was prolonged. Even if the drug was helping me. It's horrible. I have a cardiologist appointment soon because I got minor chest pains during exercise a few weeks ago. Which doesn't sound particularly bad, but that, coupled with the knowledge of the fact that many people can have silent heart attacks and asymptomatic arrhythmias, it's downright terrifying. I am scared about what I might find out, if I mayhaps did permanent, structural, unfixable damage to my heart muscle from a only a several month long bulimic episode, and am now much, much more vulnerable to cardiac events.... I almost don't want to go. 

Now what's weird about this phobia, is that I currently am using Xanax at night and meth during the day and I'm also a smoker. Its weird how those three things are pretty not-good for you, yet I have less anxiety about smoking a cig or a bowl of meth than taking an anti depressant???!???

It's so irrational and honestly I believe it's an ocd thing as I also tend to take my blood pressure 4-20 times a day (no fucking joke) and weigh my self constantly and also check my pulse to see if my heart rhythm is ""normal"" about 10x a day. My blood pressure is so good that even as I am fucking high out of my mind on meth and just smoked a cig, the highest it goes is like 130/85 (which, insanely and funnily enough, is still probably lower than like 70% of Americas blood pressure, lmao), which is just slightly hypertensive. It's normally, with only the Cigs and no meth, like 90/60, sometimes even like 85/57, no lie. I attribute it to my whole food/plant based diet. I'm not really sure why I still compulsively take my BP. But anyway This anxiety is destroying me. I really do think I need to be on an SSRI or something, but I guarantee I could not even take a single benadryl without panicking hardcore.

So. Does anyone deal with this fear of an abnormal heart rhythm specifically? I just wonder how common it is. And how people deal with it. (/end Xanax fueled rant about my mental issues.

healthanxiety,viktoriahoedl,2018/02/06,"Swallowing air, mostly when laying on my back Since the start of this year I‘ve had really weird symptoms. It started when i suddenly noticed some faint clicking noises at the back of my throat. I got very scared because i was high (on weed) at that time and since weed does trigger paranoia I was sent into a full-blown panic attack. While being in a panic attack I first started swallowing a lot of air due to an anxiety reflex. After sobering up, I was back to normal. But stupid me thought it was okay to smoke weed again so I had my next panic attack, shaking and just feeling and hearing all the air move in my stomach and abdomen. At this point i quit smoking. Yet after that incident i noticed, that whenever I laid down on my back and swallowed(mostly the normal spit-swallow reflex) i could hear and feel tiny air bubbles travel down my esophagus. this happens absolutely subconsciously, I cannot control it. I’ve also noticed how sometimes my ears and my throat hurts. Now I‘ve become extremely aware of how i breathe, how I swallow and  when I feel or hear something weird in my body and this led to searching the internet for various reasons as to why this may be happening to me. I‘ve thought about hiatus hernia(the conditions where the diaphragm pushes into the stomach or the esophagus), GERD(but I‘ve never noticed any acidic reflux), and so on... It‘s gotten so bad that some nights I can‘t even sleep because I‘m having such bad anxiety about my symptoms... I‘ve gone to three different doctors, the first one completely ignored my symptoms and just said the bloating comes from an intestinal infection(or something like that idk), the second one sent me to a therapist to whom I‘ll go to in march and the third one didn‘t find anything wtong with me, just like the first one. It‘s extremely hard for me to live with this condition, because wherever I searched, I‘ve found absolutely nothing that actually led me to an illness or such. I‘m using simeticon to relieve the bloating, because I‘m not able to burp all of the air out. But I may add that I do burp a lot because of the subconcious air swallowing which sometimes happens eventhough I‘m not laying down. When I lay down on my back though, it happens almost constant.

healthanxiety,Ballsonhard,2018/02/06,"Terrified of a brain CT scan I had Sorry guys, long post but I just need to get this off my chest and I feel like I'm going crazy...
Firstly, I'm a 23 y.o. male in relatively good health training and playing sports 4ish times a week.

So recently I was having a weird pain on the right side of my brain and ongoing pressure that didn't go away for about 4 days. Eventually I went to the doctor who said we should do a 'scan' for reassurance to check if it was serious.

I stupidly just went along with radiology and did a brain CT scan when I could have asked for an MRI. Now days later I'm absolutely terrified of the affects of that CT radiation on my brain/body and so much regret I didn't speak up and demand an MRI instead. I've been emailing the clinic and they said that on average a brain CT with the machine (Siemens 64 slice Perspective) they use gives 1 mSv for a brain CT (I'm worried that this is just for a brain scan and that the person doing it would have hit my head among other body parts so the dosage might have been higher). 

I've now been reading about ionizing radiation for the past few days non-stop with occasional glimpses of hope about how overall the radiation impacted me is nominal compared to the background we receive. But then there are so many questions that stress me out, is receiving a large dose in one go the same as a 2/3 a year of exposure to the body? How much radiation can our bodies deal with? Is there now mutated DNA in my body that could cause problems in the future? Am I more sensitive to radiation than a normal person?

I can't sleep properly and I spend my days distracted reading about the odds of contracting a fatal cancer because of a stupid CT scan I could have said no to. I just want some proof to say ""look, the radiation you received is minor and there is almost no risk with the CT"". I've read every resource there is (I think) and done every calculator I could and it still stresses me out. **This fear of cancer is partially because I lost my mother when I was quite young to lung cancer and I'm just terrified hereditary impact this has on me**

healthanxiety,iamthegoldengod69,2018/02/06,"What is wrong with me? I’ve always been extremely articulate and smart. I operated on a higher consciousness than most people just in the sense that I was more aware of my surroundings and I thought deeply about things. I was also quick witted and being funny was probably my defining personality trait. Until about a week ago, I felt like my normal self (still a very anxious person regarding my health, particularly a brain tumor). Now I just feel like there’s been a substantial cognitive decline. I can’t think as deeply and I’m constantly second guessing myself on if I’m using words correctly. I feel Ike my vocabulary is getting worse and I google synonyms for words about 30 times a day. At the same time, I also feel more relaxed. It sounds weird but I’d rather feel smart and anxious than dumb and relaxed. I’m not even particularly happy. I feel like I have no emotions (something that has been persisting for a while) but now I feel like I have no intelligence (something new to me). I am slower to respond in arguments and don’t feel as witty as I was two weeks ago. Maybe I’m thinking too much about my speech but I just wish I could revert back to normal. Everything just feels so superficial to me. It’s weird. I know a symptom of brain tumors is a shift in consciousness. I’m messing up when I talk a lot more. I feel like I’m forgetting words and not winning in arguments (very rare for me). I’m only 15 (almost 16) and feel like I have Alzheimer’s or something. On a side site, the only other truly concerning symptom I have that could be indicative of something more serious is the smell of smoke occasionally. This isn’t a daily occurrence or even a weekly but maybe once or twice a month, I’ll get a whiff of the faint smell of smoke that is certainly not coming from real life. As of lately, I just feel so dumb. I just can’t stress the fact that I’ve never felt this way before. I hate this feeling. I haven’t really had emotions for a while (this is due to some trauma I’ve been through) but lack of intelligence is brand new. I may not be completely devoid of my intellect (as I’m able to express my thoughts coherently in this format) but I feel slower than usual. I use to partake in writing creative stories and stuff and I tried to do that yesterday and I struggled and was uncharacteristically out of ideas. Sorry if this sounds repetitive but this has been going on for about a week now and I’m not sure what’s up. My parents won’t let me get an CAT Scan (I got an MRI in March 2016 and everything was fine). Is there a possibly a tumor could’ve developed in this short of amount of time? Thoughts and opinions please. I just feel like a completely different person



Also sometimes when I’d feel really weird or things would get too heavy, I’d cry and the feelings would subside. Now I can’t even cry cause I feel like I don’t even have feelings in the first place. I use to be able to explain this perfectly all the time (or so it felt like) and I took great pride in my ability to articulate things. Now I feel like whenever I do so, there’s a little voice in my head questioning what I say and if it makes complete sense.

It doesn't hurt but I've regrettable done something bad. I've let myself have bad thoughts, then fueled them with the dreaded Google...PLEASE HELP.

1. I saw where it could be just benign twitching...COULD BE. Last year I went to the gym and may have lifted  wrong so the next day I had arm twitching almost all day. But for this case I haven't been to the gym since Monday! (Now Wednesday). Can't be that...right?

2. Stress can cause an overload of muscle stuff...even if I sleep? I'm dissecting everything right now. Yes it's been a hard month with you health fears and questions and stress but I'm now like thinking to myself I'm not really that stressed can that truly be the cause?

3. Google sucks, it's the worst type of fear enabler, yet so accessible. I'm finding so much, Lou Gherigs disease??? Ahh!!! I can see the twitch so that's promising but I'm finding it hard to no look up other symptoms...is it possible???

4. Heart issues! I've always been focused on cancer and stuff along those lines but now I'm freak g about heart stuff. My fit bit typically sometimes shows a range of 58-119+bpm depending on exercise, and relaxation etc. 
I didn't sleep with it last night, but as soon as I saw the heart stuff on Google that heart arythmia and skipping beats I ran to put it on. It ran 54 bpm... then at 66  down to 61 bpm (granted back In bed in my safe zone) but what if my heart is beating too low??? It's slowly shutting off and gave me the leg twitch as a signal?!?!   

I'm terrified again, upset I'm stressing out about this and worried I might not get out of bed today.

Please help, I could use any words or advice. So scared...",1.50716698534098,3.99823197131932,2.36208126195029,93.6529753027406,83.9713193116635,5.32223072020395,21.7185787125558

I literally have no reason in my current life to be so down sometimes but I am and I hate it. I'm literally crying. My grandmother, two of her sons, and one of my female cousins have diabetes. My mom does not and neither does my 14 year old sister. I'm 28, eat relatively healthy but was pretty sedentary up until 3 weeks ago. 

I weigh 151.7 and I've started exercising 6 days per week (1 hour Zumba) super high intensity with plyometrics incorporated and have felt pretty great. I have remained at around the same weight despite all of this. I went out last Thursday (about a week ago) and got drunk which I never really do. I rarely drink but I felt so terrible and I'm not doing that again. I was super dehydrated and felt like crap all weekend but I still went to Zumba that Saturday. Out of nowhere, I start thinking about diabetes and now I'm freaked the heck out.

 I went through all of my medical records from the past couple of years to try to calm me down, fasting glucose at 96, at 78, at 87, most recent in December 2017 was 96. On 5/5/2016 my a1c with eAG estimation was 5.0 and my a1c today was 4.9. I did eat a small tub of mangoes from HEB and a green juice prior to my glucose test and that came back at 148. This was literally 10-15 mins after eating. I've had some random shooting pain all over my body for a while now, and for the past couple of days (Sunday) I have cold feet I cannot warm up at all. 

Granted, my whole legs hurt and they feel cold from my butt down. My muscles are pretty sore as I've been doing squats and jumping all over the place for an hour daily. I took a rest day today. I seem to find charts and charts about ""normal"" diabetic ranges but not normal non diabetic ranges for immediately post meal and that 148 is freaking me out despite of the a1c level.

Should I be worried? Also, I started new birth control (Vienva - generic for Aviane) and I think this may be causing the cold feet? and maybe the anxiety to go to extremes? I asked the Dr. on Nurx about the birth control and she said it's not a normal side effect of the medication although it is my experience that sometimes they aren't aware of all. 

My health anxiety started about two years ago with a diagnosis of H. Pylori (which has been resolved naturally) as the Flagyl and antibiotics caused the first ever anxiety bout I've ever had and continues today.  I also had my gallbladder removed and then went to a gastro who said I didn't even need it taken out despite pain attacks. 

I've had EKG's, Echo, CT of the pelvis and abdomen with contrast ad I was also getting palpitations. Determined those are PVC's but I did not want to take beta blockers if nothing is structurally wrong with my heart.

healthanxiety,catch_99,2018/02/10,"Rabies Anxiety - Long Term Incubation I'm not sure how many of you are familiar with rabies as the subject of your health anxiety, but one of the worrisome things about it is that there have been documented cases where the incubation period after exposure to the virus has been years and years, as high as 25 years in one case (although the evidence for it is not definite). A few other examples of long incubation periods include 4 - 6 years, and around 15.  

My fear here is that despite not having rabies yet, I am incubating this terrifying virus and will ultimately die from encephalitis and insanity, which is the outcome of all rabies diagnoses. 

11 years and 8 months ago I handled two baby raccoons over a period of days my aunt found in her yard after her dog killed the mother. We kept them for probably 3 days, and I would imagine my aunt had them for 2 or 3 days as well, before we gave them to a local animal hospital which gave them to a local wildlife rehabilitation center before release. After dropping them off with the clinic we never heard anything else from them. My father confirmed with me yesterday that he left his contact information. I called them yesterday and they don't have documentation about it that far back, but the woman on the phone was not exactly reassuring because apparently a local, unlicensed person was doing the rehabilitation back then. Still, it's someone who would have had the animals in their care for a period of time that would have seen anything to indicate rabies.

I don't recall the animals behaving strangely, but that doesn't say much. I also don't recall being scratched to show blood (maybe some white-marking from their little claws, but no deep contact) and if they did get saliva on me, I don't imagine it was on an open wound. My aunt, father, two neighborhood friends have not gotten rabies. We never heard anything back from the animal hospital. The only report of raccoon rabies is from 2003, before this happened in 2006. In that county in 2006 there was only one documented case of raccoon rabies in the wild (not humans). For the length of time we had the animals, we would have seen some sort of odd behavior. 

And it's been almost 12 years. What are the chances I'm a case study for long term rabies incubation?

Now that I am talking with my husband about having a baby, I'm starting to worry that I could have hep c, and could pass it to my baby.  You might think ""Easy, just get tested"" but that would stress me out more than anything.  There are so many false positives, not to mention the fact that if the healthcare law changes, I could have a ""preexisting condition"" on my record.

My therapist doesn't think I should worry.  I am not a baby boomer, IV drug user, never had any blood transfusions, my only unprotected sex partner is my husband, etc...none of the major risk factors.  But I can't stop thinking about the few manicures I've gotten in my life.  I've only ever gotten about ten manicures at a salon, but I've read that this is a possible mode of transmission.  Of course the logic side of my brain tells me that most women get FAR more than 10 manis in their life, and most women do not have hep c...but I can't stop thinking about it, especially because I've bled on a few occasions during manis (I've had probably about 20 pedicures in my life, but they were at a high end salon that showed off how well they sterilized everything)

Also, I got a tooth pulled in 1997...I assume that's late enough in history for them to be sanitizing everything, but who knows?

About 4 years ago, I had a CMP blood test done and my liver enzymes showed up normal.  I assume that if I had had hep C for *that* long, something would have been amiss.  But I still can't stop worrying.

my therapist thinks I'm clinging to this because I'm secretly more worried about being a mother, or the changes a baby will bring, but I've hyperfocused on this to distract me from the ""real"" concerns....

It all started with a bad infection that almost costed me a finger. Since then I've thought I had cancer, autoimmune diseases, genetic disorders, neurological disorders, diabetes, severe mental issues beyond anxiety, and a whole bunch of crap. Luckily, I saw how ridiculous this was before it got too severe (hehe it probably is but not as much as it could possibly get). 

Now my problem is my heart. I know it is supposed to speed up when having stress, anxiety or panic, I know why my fingers tingle, I know why I hyperventilate and how it makes things worse, I know why I get headaches, I know! My issue is that it speeds up in a way that I think is too fast. For example, during anxious moments my heart rate is around 100-120: normal and I understand. During panic attacks my heart rate is about 180-205: not normal. 
My question is if anyone relates to this? 

The funny (not really funny) thing about anxiety is that the symptoms cycle. Anxiety is a smart cookie who knows how to fool you pretty bad. I've been writing down EVERYTHING since this started and I've learned a lot about how it works. I've solved my past ""diseases"" by finding the flaw in my thinking process but this time I can't. I can count my heart rate when it is  that fast. I believe heart anxiety is one of the most difficult ones to beat because the heart does some weird things that we're not supposed to feel but anxiety allows you to. I get ectopic beats ( My heart stops for a few seconds and then beats strongly again) which I know are normal but I feel them and people are not supposed to feel them. It's all due to my anxiety.

I've had some nasty health anxiety that's been going on since I had brief exposure to asbestos tile about a month ago during some home renovation. Ever since then, I've been convinced that I've acquired cancer of the mouth/throat. I recently went to the dentist to check out some mouth sores and bumps, and they were found to be nothing. 

For the last week and a half, I've had some issues with what feels like swallowing on my right side of my throat. No real pain, but also no lumps or bumps in my throat or neck to speak of. Recently though, I chose to feel in the back of my throats and felt what feels like cartilage/bone on the right side of my throat. It is a hard ridge, and doesn't appear on my left side. I don't have any pain, and haven't had any other symptoms to speak of. I'm wondering If anyone would have any idea what this is, or maybe it's just normal and I'm overly paranoid due to my recent health anxiety. 

My fiancé is a PA student and hasn't been overly concerned at all, and at my physical a month ago a blood test showed normal white blood cell count.

I was out walking today, around 12:00 noon, and when I passed a tree I heard a flapping of wings, but I didn't see if it was a bird.

For some reason, I felt the need to check my hand, due to the slightest feeling I may or may not have made up in my head, and I regret ever deciding to so. I found a small scratch, with two little hole-like cuts about a centimeter apart with little scab linings connecting the holes. I'm deathly afraid that I got bitten by a bat and didn't really feel it. I'll include a picture of the cut as well. Does anyone have any information on bats and bat bites?

healthanxiety,darlingotter,2018/02/14,"Distrust of doctors and diagnoses - how to overcome? I've had quite severe health anxiety for a few years. It's hopped from one malady to another, and medical counsel/tests do not assuage it as I'm always convinced they've missed something.

Most recently it's cancer - at first lymphoma, now cancer in general. I've visited specialists, GPs, had chest xrays and bloodwork, and finally a full CT scan with contrast. Despite the all clear in each instance, I spend a debilitating amount of energy on the anxiety they've missed something. Each diagnostic procedure seems to buy me a few weeks of calm before the terror and doubt returns.

I do not have systemic symptoms of cancer and am in apparent good health save mild diagnosed GERD -- but compulsive google'ing assures me many healthy people in their early 30s are diagnosed with terminal cancer out of the blue, after numerous misdiagnoses etc. That GERD must be stomach cancer, the lymph node that swelled after a dental infection must be lymphoma, the doctors are brushing me off, the medical system in Korea is inadequate, the medical system in Australia is inadequate (I've carried this pattern through the doctor's offices of three nations!)

I recognize the compulsive and anxious biases I'm operating on here, but I don't know how to change them. For those who have endured something similar - how do you learn to trust the doctors' ""all clear""? How do you trust that you would probably show some obvious symptoms in case of serious illness, and those symptoms would be correctly interpreted?

healthanxiety,curbnola,2018/02/14,"Absolutely terrified of having autism. Does anyone have fears of mental illness/ developmental delay? This would honestly be funny if it didn’t scare me so badly. I don’t really even know why it scares me this much, and I feel bad because autism isn’t strictly a negative. It’s just a different wiring of the brain that emphasizes different skills. It’s dumb, but I can’t help it. 

Last night I had a nightmare that I was actually autistic and that no one had ever told me so that I could live a more normal life. The whole thing shattered my perspective of myself in a way that was profoundly uncomfortable and was kind of from a third person view although I felt everything very intensely. I looked quite different, but the thing that freaks me out is that what if I actually do look like that and just have a very limited outside perspective of myself. I also saw a bunch of ways that maybe certain interactions I thought were normal may only have felt alright because I’m actually autistic. 

This all would just be a weird one off dream if I hadn’t been terrified of being autistic for a long period last summer. I would spend every break possible at my summer internship taking diagnostic tests to prove to myself that I don’t have it. I was an anxious mess.

Since then, I’ve had a number of fears about having different mental illnesses (everything from schizophrenia to NPD to bipolar) and don’t know quite what to do about it. I think I have ocd, but I haven’t been able to go to therapy.

I wouldn't call any of them explicitly painful, but there's a distracting discomfort that's hard to shake and when a panic attack happens, the discomfort is magnified a hundredfold. 

My mind tends to focus on one of them at a time : my chest, my abdominal area, my tooth filling, and my testicle. Doctors have already told me that each of these areas are fine, and I'm mostly mentally stable with that, but when my anxiety flares up it tells me that the doctors didn't do enough tests, they just brushed it off as imagined anxiety pains or IBS because I'm young and the probability of something serious is low. It's like my anxiety constantly picks at my defenses to see if it can get a footing and crawl into my brain.

I'm a 23-year-old female, non-smoker, otherwise healthy despite an insane amount of anxiety. I've had slightly swollen lymph nodes on my neck for a while, but doctors I've seen haven't been concerned because I weigh 116 pounds and have a really thin neck -- an ENT basically told me to dismiss it unless they actually get bigger. It's only one one side. During my appointment with the ENT though, I insisted she check my parotid glands because the left side of my face feels a bit swollen. She agreed, but said it could be caused by a ton of things. My cheek is a bit swollen on the inside, too. It's most notable right under my ear lobe, resting on my jaw. It feels like a lump that's noticeably bigger than the right side of my face.

She referred me for an MRI with contrast, and suggested I cancel a sonogram I had scheduled because an MRI would be better, anyway (I did.)

healthanxiety,HookerAllie,2018/02/18,"Health anxiety makes everyday tasks so difficult Some background about my health anxiety history - I’ve had severe health anxiety intermittently since my teens.  Most often I am preoccupied with my heart.  My heart rate has always jumped up quickly (~180ish bpm) with minimal exercise or even at times of rest, but my resting heart rate is usually 45-55 bpm.  I mention numbers just because my heart rate is a little atypical-but I have been checked out by cardiologists so many times over the past 15 years, always with the reassurance that I am fine. Most recently, this past summer I wore a 30 day holter monitor where they would measure my episodes of high heart rate. They also did a stress test, numerous ekgs, etc. They confirmed I had periods of sinus tachycardia, but it was normal rhythm and said I was healthy.  They said the heart was appropriately responding and was likely beating fast because of anxiety (which I don’t think is the whole story, I think I have a food allergy which can trigger it, but that’s beside the point.). They gave me a low dose of beta blockers to take as needed for comfort/anxiety, but promised I wouldn’t have a heart attack, with or without the pills.  

Anyways, to bring my story to today, I’ve been putting off doing laundry for far too long.  Im embarrassed to admit I have been buying new clothes to prolong my laundry chore. The issue is in my apartment I have to carry my laundry down a few flights of stairs, outside and into another building. After it’s clean I have to carry it again outside and then up a few flights of stairs. The laundry basket is heavy and my heart races so fast when I do this, and I panic. 

I just did a load and I could feel my heart beating out of my chest. I sat down with a glass of water and within 60 seconds my heart rate was back in the 70s. I remind myself that my stress test was normal, even when they brought my heart rate to 190 for several minutes. But I am still so freaked out. I have several more loads to do and I’m so afraid.

I know part of the answer is that I am incredibly out of shape and weak. This is not coincidence -I am extremely avoidant of anything that raises my heart rate , and am terrified of exercising.  I stopped wearing my Fitbit a few months ago (at the urging of my therapist) because I obsessively measured my heart rate and was even afraid of standing up/walking - I believed if my heart rate went above 80 it would trigger a heart attack.  Taking off my Fitbit was one of the scariest things I’ve done but now that it’s been a few months I feel SO much better.  I do my best not to measure heart rate now and have been going on more walks, but lifting anything makes me feel my heart rate and I can’t ignore it.   I just feel so stuck and like I can’t keep up with basic chores.  I feel like a failure of an adult. 

I don’t know what I’m asking for, this is mostly a rant. I’ve been lurking this subreddit for months and it’s brought me a lot of comfort.  Health anxiety is such a difficult illness but this community helps me feel less alone.

TLDR: my health anxiety is about my heart rate/heart attacks. Basic chores like laundry elevate my heart rate and cause panic and avoidance. Feel like I can’t keep up with life. ",4.34859587998512,5.81626760413355,4.97498968304976,83.2309268342185,70.8918918918919,7.96050468491019,29.4402124276968
healthanxiety,Kahlosa,2018/02/18,"My silly panic attack last night I'm sharing this panic attack story because I feel it represents health anxiety and might help you all to cope with physical symptoms. This might be a little long.

I had had a stressful day at work and had also done an anxiety no-no and googled my irregular period symptoms I have been having recently.  Needless to say this all made me panicky by the evening. 

When I got home I vented to my husband, smoked some high cbd low thc cannabis and worked out for an hour hoping that would calm me. It worked for the most part until bedtime.

I was laying in bed surfing the interwebs before I fell asleep when it happened. A weird physical sensation. Felt like my throat went numb. Now I had experienced  this symptom before about a year ago and at that moment I had forgotten about that. A year ago I had a full neurological check up including an MRI. Of course all results were negative and I was fine. In the moment though I couldn't remember that. 

So I started to get nervous. Is it a stroke or seizure? Is my throat closing in anaphylactic shock? I had to check to be sure. So I shove my my finger into the back of my throat feeling around. I'm pushing in really far and playing with my uvula. I can feel everything. Good okay. Throat's not numb. But wait, why am I not gagging? Thats weird. My finger's digging in but I'm not gagging at all. I think you all can guess what I did next, right? Yup, I googled it. 

What came up was horrifying. The worst results I have ever seen from Googling symptoms. Then BAM! Heart starts racing, my face goes numb and I start to shake uncontrollably. I start calling my husband's name telling him I think he should call 911. Luckily I recognize the shaking and racing heart as a panic attack and not a part of the symptoms mentioned on Google. 

My husband was a champ! He got me started on deep breathing and began to comfort me. I started to calm the panic attack pretty quickly but what I saw on Google still screamed in my head. I wondered if I could wait to go to urgent care in the morning or if I really should go to the er now. 

I always worry about the boy who cried wolf kinda symptoms. Like I keep getting weird symptoms and it's always nothing but the one time I should have gone to the er I ignored it instead. I'm sure we've all been there. 

I explain to my husband what triggered the panic attack and he insists I'm fine. Its at this point I remember I've had the numb throat feeling before and had negative MRI results. But I had never stuck my finger down my throat. Maybe if they had known I couldn't gag they would have done another test or know other symptoms to diagnose me. 

As my panic attack subsided I got up to use the bathroom. Away from my husband I tried to make myself gag with my finger again. Nothing. Next, however, I jammed my toothbrush down my throat and GAG! Oh sweet relief! I can gag! Turns out, after testing it out, I can't gag myself with my own finger. Or at least it's really hard to. 
I had jumped to conclusions because, well, how often does a person try to gag themself with their finger? 

I think a lot of our symptoms are like this. We become so sensitized and aware of our bodies we notice things we never paid attention to before and then freak out fearing the worst, or Googling it. These are really just normal body sensations that most people are able to ignore or not even feel.

I should have kept the fact I had a rough day in the back of my mind and taken a minute or two after I had noticed the first symptom to see if it went away by distracting myself. And never ever ever Google a symptom! NEVER! I know we know this, and I know how hard it is not to, but don't, and don't body check your symptoms either. Distract or truly objectively analyze your symptoms. More often than not they will go away or not be nearly as strong as they first felt. 

This was my first panic attack in over a year and I'm not letting it get me down. It has reassured me that while uncomfortable, panic attacks aren't dangerous. It also allows me to recognize my symptoms of stress leading up to an attack so next time I can perform more stringent self-care before it snowballs into an attack. These moments are only making it easier for me to recover from anxiety, not making it worse. Stay strong everyone!

healthanxiety,chantpleure,2018/02/19,"Just have to get this out Female, 33 years old, BMI 23 

April 2017 I got a cough/cold.  I continued coughing on and off for months, mostly in the morning, no other symptoms (ie no weight loss, no fatigue).  In October, after several months personal upheaval I managed to go to the Doctor who sent me for a chest x-ray just to rule out an infection.  Chest x-ray comes back with what the radiologist says could be a chest infection so it's recommended that I take antibiotics.

I take a week of amoxicillin, on the 4th day I start getting a rash on my hands and feet which starts creeping up my limbs on the following days.  I call my Dr who recommends that we switch to a different antibiotic (sorry, don't remember which one it was).  I take that for a week.  After the course is over I'm still coughing, mostly in the morning.

I go back to my Dr who sends me for another chest x-ray which comes back with no indication of infection and then my Dr sends me on to a respiratory medicine specialist.

Respiratory medicine Dr orders blood tests, chest CT scan and a breathing test.  Blood tests have come back with borderline high levels of IgM and I am FREAKING out about what this means.  No results from anything else yet.  

Respiratory medicine Dr thinks I have reflux and has put me on 40mg of an acid reducer.   At no point did she say she thinks I have any signs of anything life threatening.  

I'm just so scared.  I've always been a hypochondriac, and I am finding it really hard waiting for the results from all these tests.

I've drank loads of energy drinks in my life and I'm a bit lethargic, I don't do anything deliberately to exercise. But I'm not fat and I don't eat too badly and whatever. No family history of heart attacks at all that I know of, just a lot of cancer. But the past 5 months, literally every day I worry I'm having a heart attack. Whenever I get a bit of chest pain I sieze up and think ""Right, this is it"". And I was never a worrier before this, I'm a really confident person, don't mind getting up on a stage at all. Yet I spend a lot of my days worried shitless about heart attacks now. I went to hospital a few months ago and had a lot of tests done and they said they'd found nothing wrong with me. I had an ECG (I think it's called EKG in America?), blood test, chest x-ray, ultrasound in my belly, obviously the doc checked me out with a stethoscope, and they couldn't find anything wrong. Yet the worry didn't go away. Over Christmas it got really bad, I got scared just walking down the stairs thinking it'd kill me. I do get chest pain and I do think it's real and probably happens worse/more frequently to me than most people, but it's probably just indigestion or something, right? I do eat quite a lot of spicy food and I like fizzy drinks. I don't worry much about other things like cancer, I don't worry about them as much as I should. I just worry about heart attacks and suddenly dying. I always feel uncomfortable in my torso and I'm not sure if there's something wrong the doctors haven't found or if if's purely anxiety. I'm not prone to heart conditions or to anxiety, which came first? Which one is real? I feel a pain in my chest and I get a shooting pain down my left arm fairly often, isn't it natural for me to worry about that? I might have a heart condition that's only detectable when I move around and walk and get the heart going a bit more.

Dunno why I worry about silly shit I can't control. All I know is I have to walk 20 minutes to class this morning and I know the whole time I'm gunna be having mini panic attacks thinking any second I'm going to die. I'm not going to die, right?

Last Saturday I woke up with weirdly blurred vision in my right eye. I have pretty bad eyesight to begin with, but this was different. I thought it was because I was hungover or something, but it didn't go away. I made the mistake of googling and holy shit I'm losing my mind. Everything I'm experiencing, the blurry vision, the color distortion, the eye pain, is consistent with optic neuritis- which is usually the first symptom of MS. I'm so fucking terrified and I can't shake the feeling that I just found my death sentence. 

I went to the eye doctor and he said he didn't see any damage in my eye, but he wants me to go back in tomorrow and see if anything has changed. Which it hasn't. I still can't see worth a damn out of that eye. He said I might have to get an MRI which I'm convinced is going to show that my brain is full of lesions and tumors and all sorts of awful things.

healthanxiety,MobileChikane,2018/02/22,"Massive abdominal pains for the last 2 days... Hi guys,

I'm in a pretty bad state right now. For the last 2 days I've been having really big and sometimes debilitating pain in my abdomen area. It first started around the side of my abdomen kind of like a stitch, then throughout the day it slowly travelled to the middle just above my belly button. Last night the pain travelled down to my lower right which instantly got me worked up thinking of appendicitis.

Phoned 111 and they recommended I go to the local A&amp;E. The blood test was fine and the doctor said he doesn't think it's appendicitis. The problem is this pain has been so intense for the last 2 days and it doesn't seem to stop, just travel around my abdomen a bit, but is very intense in the lower right at the moment.

Any idea what this could be?",6.63492967651196,6.59146231012658,6.49210970464135,79.7857313642757,65.1392405063291,8.7943741209564,30.2137834036568
healthanxiety,titchmalbot,2018/02/22,"I've had health anxiety since 2012, i've been learning to manage it pretty well over the last couple years. Today I had a bit of a relapse so I wrote something to get my confidence back. Over the last 5 years I have had:

-Schizophrenia
-Pancreatic cancer
-Multiple Hernias
-Testicular cancer
-Urinary tract infections
-Blood clots / DVT
-Pulmonary embolism
-Heart attacks
-Angina
-Stomach Ulcers
-Misaligned vertebrae and ribs
-Meningitis 
-Bradycardia and Tachycardia 
-Brain Tumors
-TMJ
-Aching shoulders, neck, back
-GERD and food intolerances

Somehow I have survived all of these... 

My symptoms were:

-Headaches
-Insomnia
-Shortness of breath
-Palpitations
-Racing thoughts
-Indigestion 
-Tight aching muscles
-Dizziness 

My treatment for these was:

-Constantly checking pulse and breathing
-Checking for symmetry 
-pushing and prodding where I felt it hurt until it did hurt 
-Twisting and turning until I felt that symptom again
-Avoiding anything that I believed would make my symptoms worse (flying, eating certain foods, exercising too much or too little)
-and most importantly googling for the exact scenario I believed to be true e.g. 'headache above left ear associated with brain cancer' or 'sore achilles hill sign of DVT'

I have (literally) spent $1000's on:

-GP's (who always tell me the same thing)
-Physios
-Chiros
-Missed work
-Miracle cures (e.g. magnesium, vitamin B, etc...)
-Dietitians
-Ambulances

All to conquer my 'Sicknesses' 

The reality is though...

I was sick in 2012, I was truly diagnosed with Graves disease,

and although very treatable (and it has been treated).

it scared me to my core.

I became overaware of every sensation in my body and thought in my mind.

I believed that I needed to be aware to ensure I would survive.

This habit manifested itself into my true and worst alement health anxiety.

Health anxiety has stole time and experiences from me for 5 years.

It made me doubt myself.

It made me loathe myself.

It crippled me. 

However, I have been getting my life back over the last 2 years.

But it has taken effort, commitment and the realisation that this is here with me still (at least for the time being) and without consistent maintenance i'll end up back where I was.

Some days it still wins, but with each month those days get less and less.

My health anxiety no longer and will never again define who I am.

I constantly test my memory and feel it is declining rapidly.  I have trouble picturing things from seconds ago in my mind, all my memories no matter how distant or recent feel insanely foggy, time is flying by as I feel I’m not forming new memories, and I often can’t remember if I did something today or the day before even if it was just a few hours ago.  Scarier symptoms involve me feeling confused and unfamiliar with my own family, house, dog, etc. and feeling like I have to remind myself where I am or where I’m going.  I have brief moments of confusion where I have to piece everything together and constant memories that have nothing to do with what I’m doing (which lead me to a fear of seizures that I ended up being tested for) that have happened for he past few years when I was super anxious.  

I have had an MRI, CT, PET, 3 day eeg, and neuropsych testing and everything came back good but I can’t believe my symptoms are just anxiety and derealization since it feels it’s progressively getting worse over the past few months (which I barely have any memories of).  I honestly feel I have severe short term memory loss and have posited thy maybe I was having seizures and brain damage from alcohol but the neurologist, psychiatrist, GP, neuropsych and therapists all don’t think so.

I'm lucky in that I don't really worry about cats or dogs, since I next to never interact with them, but I'm absolutely *terrified* of a rabid bat getting into my room and biting me without my knowing it. We've had bats in our house twice now, and maybe two or three years ago, finally did an exclusion in our attic and had a professional go around and seal everything up.

I haven't slept with my window open at night for several years now, but last night, I left it open by mistake until around 4 in the morning; which, naturally, set off my anxiety. I have a screen on my window, which sort of sets against a little interior strip of wood, but it isn't tightly sealed, and there's one side that's actually quite loose (big enough that a bat *probably* could get through).

I'm trying to be very logical about this, but I'm struggling. I was in my room basically all night until I went to bed (at around 4 AM), and never saw a bat, or heard anything against the screen, but just *knowing* that my window was open, and what if a bat got in while I wasn't looking or when I left the room or something?

healthanxiety,katiebuggc,2018/02/23,"A whole slew of problems... Normal? I've been dealing with anxiety since September, specifically generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Since then I've had a few recurring symptoms that my first doctor had waved off to anxiety, but since then have gotten more common. I will be talking to a new doctor soon since I need to get back on meds after my last attempt ended, so I will be talking to them about this, but wanted others' opinions/experiences too, for comfort especially.

I had a huge fear of contracting rabies since I work with animals. I know this is not logical, since any animal that has ever scratched me (I've never been bit) has not had rabies, and since even though I exhibited some general symptoms that happened to line up with rabies, I've been this way since September. So, I'd be dead by now. 

Some of those symptoms are, like I said, pretty general and line up with anxiety-related symptoms. Minor muscle twitching, ""foggy"" thinking, being irritable, trouble swallowing/dry mouth (has never impaired eating/drinking), etc. I also have had a totally random symptom from those, which is sharp, short-lived pains in my chest, and now they're along my lower abdomen and uterus. 

My new doctor has seen me once for chest pains when they wouldn't stop one day. She said everything sounded fine as far as my heart and lungs, I wasn't experiencing limited breathing, and the pain wasn't long-lived and was sharp, not like a pressure or anything. She was hoping it was from acid reflux, which I was having issues with, but after a month of medicine for that, I'm still having that.

I'm a 33 year old stay at home mom to 2 boys. I was diagnosed with GAD at 16. I was on medicine for less than a year, but quit taking it due to not liking the way it made me feel (and not liking my dr, so I didn't want to go back). The anxiety seemed to calm down until my second son was born. I had my first panic attack 5 years ago, but thankfully don't have them often. The health anxiety started around that time too. In August 2016, I finally realized that things were getting bad and asked my gp for help for help and was put on medication and started seeing a counselor. Then my husband went through some job changes, in 2017, and of course lost insurance for 3 months each time. Then in October he accepted a job offer that moved us from Texas to the Midwest. My anxiety was behaving itself during the move and I thought that just maybe it would leave me alone. No such luck. By December, my anxiety was a houseguest of my brain that wouldn't leave. I made an appointment to talk to a dr next week, but now I've found out that she is a clinical social worker? I currently don't have insurance, but I feel that my current way of living is just not working and want to go back on the medicine. Every time I feel an ache, pain, tickle, or sniffle, I freak out.

I had severe anxiety for a year, then I used antidepressants, got a girlfriend and stabilized my anxiety for many years. I still had episodes of severe anxiety/stress and depression but it never turned into full blown health anxiety that triggered panic attacks and major anxiety symptoms until recently.

I have been very stressed thees past months and I finally had multiple panic attacks within the span of a month. Ended up in the ER 2 times. So as a person experienced with it, I thought I can overcome it more easily and systematically this time.

Last night things went off the rails. My usual symptoms- pain in my upper left chest, arm pain/numbness, and crushing fear all returned.

healthanxiety,Damianjmcgrath,2018/03/01,"Heart anxiety for no reason Hello all,

First post on here, there's some really good advice from people in here so hopefully someone will have been through something similar to me. 

I just wondered if anyone else has the same thing as me. I am anxious about having a heart issue, every day, and this doesn't seem to be based on anything at all. There's no family history, I'm relatively young (32), have had all the heart checks available with nothing being found, my cholesterol is fine, and I can do mild exercise with no pain (I'm pretty unfit and just started doing exercise so I'm at a mild level). I threw away my blood pressure monitor because I think it was feeding my anxiety but when I used to take it, it was always in the normal range. 

But every day, I'll feel my heart beating in my chest at random times. Sometimes when I'm lying on my side, and in certain positions on the sofa. Sometimes I'll feel a strange vibration feeling in my chest. Or I'll feel my heart beat normally, then seem to stop, then thump back into rhythm. My partner will put her ear to my chest and tells me it's beating normally but to me, it feels like it's thumping and missing beats.

When I get any of those sensations, I'll worry about what it means and I'll feel panicky, especially if I'm on my own, or in a situation that I can't escape from, such as a plane or recently, on the London Eye ferris wheel. Maybe it's the thought of help not being easily available to get to me. The current snow in England is making me a little panicky that help won't get to me.

Along with those weird heart sensations, I'll get chest discomfort, like a heavy indigestion feeling, sometimes odd feelings in my arm, sometimes light headed feelings. None of it is painful, it's just like weird sensations. 

I've attempted to put my chest sensations down to digestive issues such as acid reflux and I've tried eating better and exercising to improve my health but so far, it hasn't made much difference.

I don't know if there is something going on that no one can find or whether I'm literally doing it all to myself.

I'm not an anxious person normally. I can talk in public, I'm not socially anxious at all, it seems to be this one and only issue and I've no idea where it came from.

Anyway, I'm always health anxious about things like this, but it got a lot worse last week upon receiving an email that the flu is widespread and that they've been getting a large amount of cases. People in my classes claim to have it, people in my clubs claim to have it, etc. Luckily none of my five roommates (we live and share a bathroom together) have gotten it so far, but I'm still so freaked out. I obviously go above and beyond with precautions- hand washing before any kind of eating or touching my face, probiotics, Vitamin C immune supplements 1x a day, lots of fruit, water, sleep, not a lot of junk food, exercise.

Next morning, threw up 3 times (from anxiety probably), went to ER. They poked me, said ""these are swollen lymph nodes, better order some tests."" So, I got bloodwork, a CT Scan and an ultrasound. Lymphoma, or another cancer is my ultimate fear. 

Everything came back normal. Just two enflamed lymph nodes on the CT Scan. They diagnosed it a probable bacterial infection, maybe given to me by the cat I got a week before all of this started. Gave me antibiotics.

So I am about two weeks out from that, finished my antibiotics and the nodes are still the same size. Have been to GP twice since the ER, thinking I felt more nodes, he said all seems normal, and it could take a month for the nodes to go down, and they may never go down. He says he doesn't think I have lymphoma and is almost convinced fully of it.

I managed to calm myself down but every since then not a day has gone by where I don't think I could die at any second. For the most time I worry about my heart. I got pains at the top of my stomach, like someone pressing two fingers right under my ribcage, which the doctor said was acid reflux but in my mind it is always the worst. One time, years ago, I heard a commercial on the radio where a woman said ""I thought I was just gassy, turns out I was having a heart attack!"". I turned it off right away but I couldn't get it out of my head. Especially when I learned that heart attacks in women can present as stomach pains/acid reflux. Everything I feel is related to my heart. Checking my pulse constantly is the new normal. It's completely exhausting. My father has since died from a heart attack and my uncle has had many stents so that its in my family history also doesn't help.

My other main worry is about diabetes. Because my dad was very overweight, I grew up with the family doctor telling me that if you are too heavy you Will get diabetes. Now, even more so after his death, I am completely terrified. I monitor how often I pee every day and if its more than usual I freak out. I get tested every couple of years but months after the last test my mind will go to 'but what if you do have it now. It will all be your fault. You did this. You're sick and it's your fault.'

I have a lot to live for. I'm getting married later this year and I refuse to let  few chemicals in my brain screw up my life but that voice in the back (or more often than not, front) of my head is very hard to get rid of.

Today, I get a call saying that appointment was a mistake and they need to see me next week. They used the word ""serious."" My mind is racing now.

healthanxiety,fencer164,2018/03/02,"Issue with Anxiety and Throat Hey guys, 

First time posting but been dealing with anxiety for a while... A lot of my anxiety goes to my health... 3 years ago I began to have these extremely painful sores in the back of my throat. Went to a bunch of doctors and they couldn't tell me what was happening (they said it was stress). I also got oral thrush in my throat and mouth along with headaches, stomach aches, flu and cold symptoms. I began to get extremely anxious with everything that I spiraled out of control. I landed myself in a psychiatric hospital by the end. I almost lost my job, my wife, and my life because of it. Turned out I wasn't crazy but was having an adverse reaction pyhsical and mental to mold in our apartment we had recently moved  into before my symptoms popped up. Every thing gradually got better, my anxiety went way down... my health returned....But the one side effect was my throat became extremely sensitive. It easly scratches and a white scab will form while it heals. But my anxiety self that pops up during this time will freak out and go into PTSD mode remembering all the bad memories. I impulsively have to check my throat  and look at any injuries a lot during the day and even sometimes take a Q-tip and touch the area and see if the scab come off just to make sure it isn't one of those sores like before. 

Anyway I just wanted to know if anyone has gone through something similar and of anyone has some coping techniques that might help (yes I see a therapist and whatnot as well). Getting sick or feeling like I'm getting sick extremely stresses me out as well because of these issues.

healthanxiety,smiley-j,2018/03/02,"Can't stop obsessing.. Any tips? Sorry if this is a little long, but I'm new here and desperately looking for some advice. Plus it kinda helps to get it all off my chest.. 

I've been struggling with health anxiety for a little while now, and although I keep kidding myself that I'm in control, I don't feel very in control. I can't stop the constant worrying and obsessing.

It all started just over a year ago, when I spent a week in hospital. I'm not going to go into detail as to why, as I don't want to trigger anyone else's anxiety... But it wasn't a great week.

Since then, I've been fine. I have ibs, which is unfortunate as the symptoms I get seem to really trigger my anxiety. But that's the most serious problem I have. A few other minor things, asthma, skin problems, but nothing unmanageable.

I noticed my anxiety levels shifting around a year on from my hospital stay. Think it must have just been on my mind, then I had a really bad ibs flare up that threw me. Was off my food, had no energy and lots of other unpleasant things.

Ibs is more under control now, but my anxiety is not. I feel anxious in general, have quite a foggy head alot of the time, don't really feel like myself, don't want to do much, getting tired out easy, feel like crying alot. But mostly I'm struggling because I can't stop obsessing about every little thing wrong with me.

The slightest cramp or ache sends me spiraling into a panic. I can't stop googling things to find out if there is something wrong with me. Even though I don't really have any ongoing symptoms and they are more one offs. Can't stop poking and prodding looking for lumps or enlarged lymph nodes.

Any time I find the tiniest little lump (found one or two in the fat layer on my stomach) I obsess. Can't seem to stop looking for it to see if I can find it again. Most of the time I can't, any if I find anything it's tiny so logically I know it's nothing to worry about. But I just can't stop.

It really feels like it's taking over. I just feel like I'm stuck in an endless obsessive cycle of prodding, being hyper aware of every tiny sensation, looking for things wrong with me a constantly googling.

It's got to the point that when I have a nice symptom free day, I find myself looking for something that's wrong with me as I feel like i can't trust that I'm actually ok.

Anyone got any advice, or been in a similar situation? This isn't something I find easy to open up about, but I'm scared it's going to completely consume me if I don't do something.

healthanxiety,throwaway72918111,2018/03/04,"Convinced I'm dying from visiting auto body shop Hi everyone,

So basically I’m freaking out because I’m thinking about how I used to visit my estranged dad’s body shop from time to time growing up during the summer. I can’t imagine that I would have gone more than 10-15 times or so in a given summer, and some years I probably only went a couple of times, others none at all.

I would go to work with him to wash/vacuum cars, answer the phone, and sometimes wetsand cars. However, there would be times where I would follow him around to his back shop to check on his employees. Or, I would go back there to let him know that a customer was waiting for him. I’m currently freaking out bc I can’t imagine that being in that environment while guys were doing work could have been good for me, even though I wasn’t doing any sanding or painting myself. His back shop is rather large, and he would keep his garage doors open for ventilation https://imgur.com/FviJwNq see building on the left). I think I remember a couple of times in the winter I was there and he had the doors shut though. I probably opened the door to the paint booth a handful of times to scream in there that someone was waiting for him.

My biggest fear is that I’ll wind up getting cancer or something years down the line from now. I probably first went to his shop when I was 5, and stopping visiting after I was 18 or 19. I have no idea how secondhand exposure to this stuff works. Does this limited secondhand exposure to dust/paint as a kid pretty much guarantee problems down the road? Or does that typically require years of direct exposure?

Was my dad 100% in the wrong for letting me come to work with him in the first place? Part of me thinks that its quite common for kids to go their family-owned businesses, but still.

It’s gotten to the point where these thoughts dominate my mind, and its very difficult to care about anything, since I feel like I’m dead anyway.

I think its entirely possible that I’m overreacting, and this anxiety is brought on by the fact that I just graduated college and started my first job.

Can someone please let me know what they think?

First of all, I’m a 27yo female who is pretty active and in general good health. I am taking oral contraceptives so I am at a higher risk of clots. I’ve been taking the same birth control pill for 10 years without any trouble. 

I recently went on a trip and was on a bus for 15 hours straight. I did walk around or stand up every few hours or so. I also had the seat next to me for myself so i was able to extend/raise my legs and stretch out. I was very hydrated during that trip.

All of a sudden, someone (who happens to be the professor of a class I'm in) walks by and asks ""Does it smell like burning plastic in here to anyone else?"". I took a whiff, and lo and behold, there was a *very* strong odor. A repair man eventually determined the problem to be that the HVAC system was leaking fluids into the ventilation. I left the building soon after the professor made his remarks, but I did return briefly a couple times to see if it had gotten better and to retrieve the laptop I left there.

healthanxiety,yupsss,2018/03/06,"I don't wanna jump to conclusions, but I'm a little worried about diabetes Just recently I have started to have trouble sleeping. My schedule, and everything has been a little messed up. I sleep for like 3 hours wake up, and can't go back to bed for a couple of hours while I feel decently thirsty, and hungry. Eventually I fall back asleep for another couple or hours, and wake up, not able to sleep until the next time. So after I have finnaly accumulated a normal amount of sleep I will eventually get up, but I don't really feel that great, but I don't necessarily feel that bad. 

For the past two-three days it seems to have been weird. The first day it was the same cycle except I woke feeling pretty aweful. Headache, not well rested, and tired. The second day I didn't really get a full 7-8 of rest, so for most of the day I felt like I was on the verge of falling asleep if I had any downtime of not doing really anything. That night I decided I would get a full night's rest in one full go as usual. I fell asleep pretty easy, but I woke up like 4 hours later having to pee pretty bad, and feeling thirsty. I was able to immediately go back to bed though. I awoke 3 more hours later, feeling as if I have to pee again, not as bad this time, BUT my thirst was pretty intense. I chugged some water, went to the bathroom, and gone back to bed. 

So I'm kind of afraid that this could be diabetes or something. I'm not overweight, but I'm definitely not active. My eating habits aren't too great either. I eat good foods, but most definitely eat a lot of bad foods.

TL;DR: I'm not sleep well. Waking up in the middle of the night feeling thirsty, and having to pee. Thirst exclusive to night. ",3.91526315789474,4.86863504385965,5.04527777777778,84.27125,71.3684210526316,7.92222222222222,25.3611111111111

healthanxiety,tleisher,2018/03/06,"I could use some reassurance. Swollen lymph node, getting a biopsy Friday I have been having reoccurring sinus infections due to a tooth that needed a root canal. During that time, I went to an ENT who told me that my nose was a bit crooked and that was another reason. 

While I was there I thought I'd ask him about a lymph node in the back of my neck. When I first discovered it I thought it was a knot in a muscle so I tried to massage it out but it never went away. Eventually, I asked my GP about it and he said not to worry unless it grows. I don't think it has.

I told him that it had been there for at least 2 years but more likely 3-4 years. He asked if it was stable and I said yes but he wanted to get an ultra sound. 

The ultra sound tech said she thought it was just a lymph node. I asked if she thought there was cancer in it, and she didn't think so but would let my ENT make that call. 

I went to the follow up and he mentioned the ultra sound doctor thinking it was a lymph node but wanted to get a needle point biopsy on it. He said that 9/10 times it was nothing but he would be a bad doctor if he didn't check. 

This triggered my health anxiety. What if I'm that 1/10? My brother had lymphoma when he was 27, and I'm 31. So I'm terrified. 

I poked it, and it got harder, and my neck got sore, and now I can't stop checking it even though I know I need to. I'm trying not to push on it and just brush my hand across it, but it's still there and it's still freaking me out. 

A few weeks ago I had a routine physical and my blood work was normal. My white blood cells were high but they were at 8 and the range was 1-10 was normal. My GP didn't think anything was wrong aside from minor cholesterol stuff that he put me on vitamins for.

So I'm getting the biopsy on Friday, and following up on Wednesday to get the results. But in the meantime I'm spiraling here and looking for reassurance or help. 

I don't feel sluggish (aside from being tired, I have a very active 11 month old baby.) My color is good, no fever, no night sweats. I have chest pain but that's just anxiety that comes and goes with my panic attacks. My appetite is fine. My blood work came back fine.

After finally getting a nearly clean bill of health, I brought up with my doctor the one thing I didn't think about until recently. I could feel a swollen lymph node just under my jaw over my carotid artery.  what started to scare me, is that i realized I could feel that lymph node for something like 3 *months*.  My doctor immediately ordered an ultrasound, and this morning I got a really somber call from a nurse at the Dr.'s office saying I needed to see an ENT right away: I not only have the one, but *multiple* enlarged lymph nodes in that area.  My understanding is that the concern from my doctor is not just that there are multilple and they're enlarged (at least one is on the order of 2cm), but that at least one has persisted for so long, and even more alarming, I have no signs of an infection and my bloodwork is clean; apparently persistent enlarged, multiple lymph nodes with clean bloodwork is not a good sign.

healthanxiety,pixihawk,2018/03/08,"(vent) I probably got cavities from grinding my teeth for years and i'm fed up with being so anxious all the time This is my first post here, i just recently found this subreddit and it already helped me a lot just reading everyones posts. I always felt like i was completely alone in this, as my close family and friends are usually brushing me off. Also i apologize in advance, i'm not a native speaker so my english might be a bit off at times.

Anyway, the main point of this is to just... put my feelings out there. I'd guess a few of you can relate. I hope this won't be too much, since i do tend to overshare when i'm depressed and i am depressed at the moment.

I've been anxious and obsessive ever since i can remember. Couple of years ago i was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and major depression, as well as BPD. Two years ago i was also diagnosed with AvPD and OCPD. I went through DBT two times, a third time is already scheduled. I was in therapy for over 5 years, but i have to quit. I've also been on Pregabalin for two years.

Health Anxiety started last year for me, after I had finally cut ties with an emotionally abusive friend who basically made the past four years a living hell. I don't know if that was the cause but it happened around the same time. 

I've always grinded my teeth at night and i was wearing a mouth guard ever since that was discovered. However recently i lost mine, as i lost my bag during traveling (which has caused a lot of stress for me over the past week, as losing things is something i've always been anxious about), so the grinding has been worse. 

Thanks to my medication i have a very dry mouth and to top that off i also currently have a very bad cold, that's already got me on edge wether i'm developing pneumonia. 

Yesterday night was a very bad time for me. While brushing teeth my gums were bleeding a lot - i have very good oral hygiene, my doctor has never had any complaints and my gums never bleed - so brushed my teeth, used mouth wash and then went to sleep, trying to not go into the anxiety cycle again. After that however instead of falling asleep I spend hours googling things and being caught up in memories of said former abusive friend. I don't know where that came from, but it just overwhelmed me. 

Today i found a tiny black spot on my teeth, that won't go away. It looks like a tiny hole. And instead of listening to what i learned in therapy - i should've known better - i googled again. Turns out you can get cavities from grinding your teeth and wearing them down. I am fairly certain this is what's going on and i've scheduled an appointment for Monday. And now i'm trying to find ways to get through the weekend without too much stress, because i'm worried that might make my cold even worse and... you all probably can guess how the cycle spirals downwards from here.

The thing i wanted to say about all this is the following: This sucks. Majorly. I am so tired of this anxiety, this obsessive overthinking of everything my body does; i'm tired of all these bad things that happened in the past still haunting me to this day. I'm tired of all the diagnosis i got - it feels like there's no chance of recovery because of all the things i have to work through. And i'm also tired of being aware that stress will wear my body down but that thought alone is causing me so much stress that it's a long spiral i can't seem to escape from. This right now feels like another punishment for not getting this right. I'm trying not to be too negative, but the thoughts keep forming in my head. Sometimes i just wish i could start anew because after i learned in therapy just exactly how all my problems started and how they escalated, i just wish i could redo my life and stop the anxiety before it even got this bad. 

I will continue to work through this. As we all do. I know that me wishing for a new start will never come to be and maybe that wouldn't even be for the best. I know i'm not and neither is anyone else here responsible for this condition. Right now it just felt like the thoughts were overwhelming me and i needed to tell someone. I know this can be beat, i just feel at a low point right now.

I always do this...I work to ignore little things day after day that *could* be symptoms of something bigger, until suddenly I find that one thing that affirms that I’ve been negligent and now I’ll pay the price. 

I’ve been in the obsession spiral since 11am today. I recently gave myself an undercut and I checked the back of my head in the mirror before leaving the house to get lunch and noticed a huge spot of hair missing at my neckline. 

By the time I got to the restaurant I was on a website confirming that I do in fact have lupus and sobbing while playing the conversation in my head of having to tell my mother.

For a moment I break through the cloud and say look at yourself! You noticed what MIGHT be a bald spot and now you definitely have lupus?? Get out of the spiral. You’re fine. 

Then I fall right back in. How dare I enjoy this hot dog right now like nothing is wrong!? I have lupus for god’s sake.

healthanxiety,headachewtfomgbbq,2018/03/10,"I feel like an idiot for posting here but here goes: Brain tumor/cancer worries I feel like a dummy, but I've definitely suffered from health anxiety in the past(pregnancy scares with my ex, lymphoma scares, diabetes scares, etc) so I'm hoping this is just another case of me being a hypochondriac.

For the past 2 weeks or so I've had this strange feeling in my head. I can't really call it a headache, its more of a ""pressure"" that can be felt throughout my head and sometimes more on the top. I wouldn't say its painful, just a really annoying feeling. I also feel somewhat of a ""pressure"" type feeling in my ears from time to time, with associated tinnitus. I've had minor hearing loss/tinnitus before this headache started, but obviously Dr. Google has indicated to me that this could be a tumor. I saw my doctor about it last week and he said that its more likely a tension headache, but that if the symptoms continued and I was still worried he'd order a head CT for me ( have a physical exam scheduled in a few days). I have no other symptoms or problems, and I'm a pretty damn healthy/active 23 year old.

I guess i dont know what I'm asking for here, maybe just words of support from other people who have experienced something similar?

A year ago I found out that I had a wart in my throat ""possibly linked to HPV"". It was removed and biopsy confirmed as benign. HPV, specifically HPV-16 found to be a major risk factor for oral/throat cancers possibly contracted by kissing, oral sex, towels and other methods.

It triggered major health anxiety within me and my life practically ended. I quit my job, I stopped any type of intimate relationships and basically waiting for life to have a miserable cancer ending.

I did about 10 times oral sex in my life in total (about 5 different women) and now I'm certain I contracted HPV in my throat according to the statistics that everyone got that virus.

I don't even know if I should vaccinate (I'm 36) because the manufacturer itself says it could increase the risk of cancer if you already got infected with HPV-16/HPV-18.

Yes I know in 90% the immune system clears it, in the rest of the cases, you are as good as dead.

There is no cure, there is no test and I'm positive I'm headed for cancer. 

I tried doctors, GPs, ENTs, CBT therapists, alternative therapists, nothing works for me.

My life is practically over.

I considered to start taking AHCC pills which women (and some preliminary trial) claim can help clear HPV faster just in case I did contract it (I can never know).

I haven't smoked since 2015 (though I've gotten a slight second hand high from sitting in a car with my friends)

I recently figured I might as well try some as I've had trouble falling asleep and I don't want to use heavier drugs to get to bed. Well I smoked a small amount but immediately it made my heart beat so hard it almost felt painful. I had a minor panic attack but after a few minutes I went to bed.

This month has been full of health issues and to try to make it a long story short, an eating disorder gave me a ton of symptoms that I didn't even consider were from not eating such as really bad nerve pain, dizziness, lethargy, LOTS of weight loss, etc. I was POSITIVE the nerve pain, positioned right over my left chest, was a heart attack and went to the ER at 4am. They did an EKG, a blood test, urine test, a full physical and xray. Everything was a-okay aside from malnutrition and general ED signs.

I started eating regularly and every symptom went away completely. I feel healthier than I have in a long time (go figure. eating helps) and I felt reassured and content for about 3 weeks.

Something else that is important to note is I had shingles at around age 15 with very swollen and painful lymph nodes and a lot of them never went down.

healthanxiety,anxious_idiot,2018/03/14,"Rabies Anxiety I’ve had a series of hypochondriac scares over the past few years, but most recently I’ve been concerned about rabies. About ten days ago I let my indoor cat out in the backyard to sun herself and I caught her hissing at (what I think is) a neighbor’s cat that had jumped over the fence. I didn’t want them to get in a fight so I shoo’d the other cat away and waited outside for my cat to calm down. After about ten minutes I picked up my cat to bring her inside and she freaked out and bit me. Since then, the though that she might have given me rabies has been constantly on my mind, causing a great deal of anxiety. I know that my cat is vaccinated (she was given a 3 year booster 2 and 1/2 years ago) and the neighbor cat was not rabid. I know that rabies, especially from cat to humans, is very rare in the US. I know that I’m being absolutely ridiculous, but knowing that doesn’t help. I keep thinking maybe the booster wore off prematurely, or the neighbor cat did have rabies and my cat bit her before biting me. It doesn’t help that I woke up today with a headache and a sore throat, two early symptoms of rabies, and that I’ve been having nightmares where I loose my mind and become aggressive.

healthanxiety,tphillips1990,2018/03/15,"I'm convinced I may have blood clots in my leg. At the start of the week, the box spring of my bed caved in while I was sleeping. I didn't notice this as I'm a deep sleeper. When I woke up, I realized this and noticed my lower back was in great pain and my right leg felt like it was on the verge of cramping. It wasn't impossible to walk, just difficult, and I assumed it was mostly because of my back. 

A day later, my leg is in great pain and I'm only able to be comfortable in very specific situations. This time, I can only walk a little due to the pain increasing. I still figured it was just some sort of leg cramp waiting to happen, but I kept noticing a pulsating sensation in my thigh and shin. I replaced my box spring and was able to rest, somewhat, even though the pain is very noticeable. 

The morning of the third day, I was woken up by the pain in my leg. I can walk but at this point, it's unbearable. It's as if I'm experiencing a perpetual leg cramp. I look into my symptoms a bit and can no longer shake the fear that I may have developed blood clots after my box spring caved in so I arrange for someone to take me to the hospital (I couldn't drive). This was sheer agony as it has become impossible for me to sit upright. Despite the fact that they recognized I was in great pain, the doctor didn't perform an ultrasound. She told me I had no symptoms of a blood clot and that I just had a muscle spasm. I was prescribed baclofen, meloxicam, and lisinopril *(slightly unrelated, it seems I had high blood pressure on three consecutive visits and apparently this was a cause for concern)*. 

I went home, took the pills, and tried to sleep, thinking all I could do was rest. I wake up a few hours later to find the pain is even worse and my right foot is tingly. I had to get a second opinion. I arrange for a second trip to a different hospital and again, they recognized how much pain I was in and rushed me through. The only problem was...this doctor seemed almost apathetic.

A month ago I discovered I have floaters and I am only 20 years old. Read around for a while and discovered that the appearance of floaters is a usual sign of retinal detachment. However, it will also be accompanied with partial vision loss and light flashes.

What do those flashes look like?
Are they like shooting stars?
Like a camera flash?
Or like half or all vision suddenly gets brighter like its 12pm in the middle of a desert?

I had a whole physical a couple weeks ago.  I know I got to work on weight and diet.  However, bp was great, urine no sugar or blood.  Bloodwork will take a couple days to get back.  I addressed all my heart anxiety fears.  Got an EKG too and the doctor said I had “pretty” pqrts (or whatever it’s called).
I do have Hashimotos, but not on medicine as of right now.

I have suffered from anxiety/depression past 18 years (I’m 35 now).  It was SOOOO bad.  Frequent trips to doctors, ER, urgent cares.  Every single possible test done.  I have always been “okay”.  Then I was okay for a long while.  Or at least all my symptoms became manageable.

I was wondering if there was anyone to talk to about this.  Why do I IMMEDIATELY think I’m dying?  Why do I feel like I’ve failed when I’ve been alright for many years.  Why do I physically feel something and think I’m for sure dying?

Last night I had a headache and convinced myself it was a stroke.  I spent an hour staring in the mirror and doing self administered stroke tests.  Today I feel like little pings of pain (but not really even pain, but not a shock feeling either, just feel something), mostly in my right arm/hand.  I am trying to tell myself it’s not a heart attack.  

I just want to know I’ll be okay.  I wish every day I could brush things off or rationalize it better.  I sometimes can and then there are times like this where I’m freaking out on the inside.  The funny thing is, in my day to day life I function.  I’m a mom, I have a job.  I also happen to have a husband who has been battling cancer for the last 2 years.  I do what I have to do.  But inside my head, I feel like a prisoner because it is so consuming.

About two months ago my parents got divorced, and recenty things haven't been too good within the family. I noticed slight pain in my stomach about three weeks ago and haven't got rid of this creeping feeling of anxiety since. 
So, today at work I go normally to the restroom and strech my groin since ot was feeling a bit stiff. While feeling the groin with my hand I notice a bump and freak out completely. It's about 2cm long and quite narrow. 
My first thought is obviously lymphoma. I mean how could it not be... I haven't been sick since the first week of January so it can't have swollen on it's own right?? Then I connect the weird feelings in my stomach during the last three weeks to the bump and the anxiety is back all guns blazing.

I have previously noticed two other lymph nodes one in each groin and they feel similar but slightly larger. The only reason why I think its a swollen lymph node is because I haven't noticed it earlier (I dont check my groins very often).

When he examined it he found that it was coming off of breast tissue of my right breast and ordered a mammogram and ultrasound which I had Wednesday.

They found three lumps in my breast (not including what is under my arm) as well as my lymph nodes being enlarged. The only reason I know this is because I saw this on the ultrasound and asked the sonographer (sp?).

She showed the doctor my results and they recommended a CT Scan with Contrast and are sending me to a specialist.

About two years ago I passed out in my bedroom after riding home from work by bike on a cold day. Immediately jumped into a hot shower. Felt dizzy, confused, and then boom, hit the ground. Was kind of half aware half unaware, but then had a killer headache after a bit and slept it off.

Went about my regular day for a good 4 months until I was playing league and all of a sudden the cursor disappeared whenever it went past my right eye.

Then slow creeping numbness up my left arm all the way to my face. Somehow managed to call 911 and they brought me in by ambulance. Diagnosed migraines. MRI was clean.

After some fighting with myself, I went and got myself tested. Blood test showed nothing and I was able to relax and calm myself, and it felt like the frequent urination problem I had stopped after hearing that.
 
The problem came back though in last November. In December 2017, I got myself tested once again for it, this time they gave me a urine test. Saying that they would do a blood test if the sugar in it was high enough. Which did worry me a little because it wasn't what I was used to seeing with diabetic tests, but I did my best to trust it.  They didn't need to do the blood test and said that things were okay.

Then this year, I felt i started to doubt it, thinking I was being misdiagnosed, that the test wasn't accurate enough and that I do have it, they just haven't figured it out yet.

I feel I'm gonna go back to my doctor's for a 3rd time to get tested because I'm waking up at night to urinate. But I don't know how to stop obsessing and panicking over this. It feels like every time something minimal goes wrong with my body. My mind is sent into overdrive, thinking it's something truly awful going on with me. 

I was diagnosed with anxiety, I know that much. So much that it feels like it does effect my day to day life a bit. I'm gonna try and get some therapy for it hopefully soon. ",4.73279220779221,5.32645089393939,5.74067532467533,81.3338701298701,69.2813852813853,8.93056277056277,28.387012987013

healthanxiety,sufferinginpnw,2018/03/19,"new here and need support Hello,
I am a sufferer of health anxiety and have been learning a lot about this disorder recently. I've always battled anxiety and depression but it hit an entirely new level when I was pregnant with my son (who is now 4) and since his birth. Throughout his pregnancy, I was convinced something was wrong with him. I was never relaxed or trusting, despite having a textbook pregnancy with no issues. 
Since his birth, I have been obsessed-- and I do mean OBSESSED-- with having breast cancer. I have had an absolute terror of cancer my whole life but it has reached a new level of hell in the past few years. I have to say-- and this is me venting here-- I am incredibly resentful of the overabundance of information on the internet about breast cancer because every time I google anything to do with my boobs it comes up as cancer. And it's because of this I have ended up in my lady doctor's office 4 times now, showing her my breasts and the new dimple or vein or whatever that I have recently discovered. 

In my research on health anxiety, I have learned that it falls more on the OCD spectrum than anything else, which makes a lot of sense to me. My fear of breast cancer has become an obsession, taking over my life at times and preventing me from enjoying anything. And the way I ""deal"" with it is compulsive-- by chronically checking myself, over and over and over again, in the mirror with my hands, etc. I feel like I am discovering some new symptom every other day.

Before anyone asks, no, I have not had a mammogram. I stopped breastfeeding my son 4 months ago and was advised to wait until at least 6 months. I have had my breasts looked at and examined and, each time, the doctor has said that things look and feel totally normal. They've also reminded me that by breastfeeding my son past 2 years, I have reduced my lifetime risk for BC by 30-40%. 
I (mostly) know this is irrational, and that my behavior mimics OCD. I am reading books on the subject, and have schedule an appointment with a specialist who uses EMDR for trauma and anxiety. So, hopefully those things will help. I have tried 4 different types of medications and none have worked because, apparently, I am one of the people for whom SSRIs don't work. Lucky me!

healthanxiety,Interesting_Bullfrog,2018/03/20,"Breast Cancer Worries Hi everyone, I'm sure this is nothing new but I really needed to get it out.


My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer a few months ago and is currently going through chemo. I've had bad health anxiety all my life and my mom's diagnosis has pretty much put me over the edge.


My left breast (same as the one she found her cancer in) felt sore, so of course I squeezed and kneaded the hell out of it trying to feel something. I didn't feel anything other than the fact that it is slightly bigger than the other, which is something I've known for a while but now I'm second guessing myself. The soreness went away with my last period, and then returned this month. Again, I squeezed and checked it compulsively. I cannot keep my hands off it. Always checking to see if it feels better or worse. My SO gently suggested that this isn't helping but I can't seem to stop. Now that my period has arrived, it feels much better but there's still one spot that hurts to poke. I've also lost 70lbs in the past couple years so my breasts don't look great for a 26 year old and I think that contributes to my worry. I'm always looking for symmetry to assuage my fears.


And now I've developed a rash that I'm pretty sure is from stress. It started on my stomach and is spreading. This prompted me to look up inflammatory breast cancer and I've basically given myself a death sentence.  I'm going to the clinic tomorrow to have it checked out but every fibre of my being wants to cancel and just hope it goes away. I'm also going to request a referral for an ultrasound. 


I'm sorry if this is all over the place. I usually talk to my parents about my fears but obviously I don't want to bring this up. Besides the anxiety it's causing, I also feel so horrible and selfish. Has anyone else imagined (or basically given themselves) symptoms after a family member or friend has been diagnosed with an illness? Any suggestions on how to function normally? I'm exhausted from the constant adrenaline rushes  :(

healthanxiety,WhosThatGirl143,2018/03/20,"Uncontrollable HIV anxiety New to Reddit so I apologise if this post is a little all over the place!

So I've struggled FOREVER with anxiety. I'm a 22 year old girl, whole jadda-jadda about troubled childhood, absent parents etc which I think has contributed to it. Over the past 3 weeks I have been utterly destroyed with anxiety that I have HIV. I've been diagnosed with OCD and depression in the past, as well as always having intrusive thoughts and being convinced that I'm on deaths door after panickingly Googling symptoms.

So basically I met a lovely guy, we really hit it off, going on lovely dates every day for about a week. Then, VERY out of character for me, we got drunk and slept together (every kind of sex, for those interested). I barely remember it and the next day I knew we hadn't used anything because we couldn't even remember how we got home, let alone anything else. Cue a panic just as we went out for breakfast the following day, and I asked if he 'had anything'. He said no, and seemed pretty offended. Well, if he was offended by that, he was even more offended when I said I thought he had HIV and proceeded to pester him all morning about when was your last test? Where do you have them done? How many people have you slept with? 

I physically couldn't eat for days, and I spent the next 2 days having to make myself sick because the anxiety was making me so nauseous. I was shaking constantly, waking up in the night in a hot sweat. In the end I spent 5 hours waiting in A&amp;E until 1am to get PEP. I had to exaggerate to get it (the guys parent's are Ghanaian and Nigerian, he was born in Cuba, but I said he was Ghanaian because I know there's a high rate there). I remember the doctor saying to me ""okay so there is some risk"" and I just started crying. I was exhausted and malnourished and felt utterly convinced at that point.

The guy in question has been so lovely. He knew how anxious I was and he picked me up the following day at 7am to go to the local clinic to prove he didn't have anything. I'm currently taking PEP. All my friends think it's hilarious how anxious I am, but honestly this anxiety is killing me. I can zone out for a good 10 minutes straight thinking about it. I'll think things like, what if I've actually got it from a previous partner? This guy has tattoos, would they test for HIV before that? What if he's taking me on all these lovely dates because he does have it and wants me to fall for him before I find out the truth? 

I had a blood test done at the end of January which was clear, and my blood test from A&amp;E was fine, and I tested negative for everything except a water infection. Even then I was thinking what if the water infection is the start? I sneeze and convince myself these are the flu-like symptoms. I see a spot on my body and I'm convinced that is the rash starting. 

Does anyone else suffer with this? I'm scared that even if I get a negative result that my anxiety will continue. ",4.04162470862471,5.47312987692308,5.14702214452215,81.8416520979021,71.5982905982906,8.6002331002331,28.8510101010101

healthanxiety,cette_femme,2018/03/20,"Those of you that Beat Cardiophobia, I Could use your Help... Hello,

Little bit of background. My younger brother has a weird heart issue. He needed a pacemaker/ICD at 21. Nobody else in my family has it, I've looked into it. I spent a whole summer getting second and third opinions from specialists in the field. I had 24 hr holter over the summer, excercise test and several EKGs. This kicked off my intense fear.

During the late fall, I started developing weird dizziness. I went to the ER twice, back to the cardiologist, everyone deemed it panic. I want to believe them. I'm trying.

The worst thing I've been doing is regularly checking my pulse, and it's always changing. The doctors don't seem to worried though. When I'm relaxed, or even just sitting and anxious, it can be 60. Sometimes it's 107. The more I focus on it, the more it fluctuates. I tried deleting the Samsung health app with the pulse ox but the curiosity always gets the better of me. I felt tired and panicky at work, I had a little coffee, and was surprised that my pulse was 66. Usually it's high when I'm stressed and have caffeine. I made a doctor's appointment and by the time I got there my pulse was 100. I showed him on the app that in the 5 minutes waiting for him to come in after the nurse took my vitals, my pulse was all over the place. 65, 84, 100, 76... He said that was normal.

I just want to be free of this. I want to stop checking and freaking out. If it's high I get scared, if it's low I get scared. The holter monitor averaged my hr at 66. When I'm take it, it seems more like the 70s. I'm seeing a therapist, but the hardest part for me it's believing I'm ok and stopping the hypervigilance and checking my pulse all the time.

healthanxiety,blackisthesoulx,2018/03/20,"Ridiculously anxious about my teeth it’s making me miserable. Hi everyone. This is my first post here. I’ve had health anxiety for around 3 years now but have only just joined reddit and thought I’d search to see if such a subreddit exists and it does. 

So yeah, I’ve had HA for 3 years. It was severely bad 3 years ago, I had a lot of stress going on but I managed to get it under control. I used to be so bad, any pain or symptom I panicked and I can’t even count the amount of times I called 999 or 111 (I’m in the UK) and had ambulances come out for me. I was at the doctors almost 3 times a week. 

Everything has been fine until recently, under a lot of stress again. A lot of uncertainty in my life and may have to uproot and leave my home (for like the 15th time in the past 3 years). Ever since the stress, the HA has crept back in. Right now, I’m petrified and convinced that I’m going to lose my two front teeth. 

I haven’t been to see a dentist in the last 5 years since they gave me 2 fillings and I had such excruciating pain afterwards for a few months whenever I drank or ate something too hot or cold I had awful pain up the side of my face. Something as simple as changing my tooth paste fixed it and I haven’t had it since. But I haven’t been in 5 years and I think that itself is what scares me. I’m not even registered at a dentist, I’m going to call round tomorrow morning to register. 

My problem is, I am convinced that my 2 front teeth wobble. Well not wobble, but they definitely move if I hold onto the tooth with my thumb and index finger and try to move each tooth. I can ever see it in the mirror (I think). It’s only slight and it’s not wobbling or twisting or anything like that. But that’s enough to have convinced me that I’m doomed and my teeth will fall out.  I smoke so I think that’s contributing to the fear. Plus I suffer from depression so I haven’t brushed as often as I should because I neglect myself. 

Has anyone else had any similar issues in relation to anxiety about their teeth? Are teeth supposed to move if you try to move them with your fingers? I did a google search (awful I know, I promised myself I would stop doing this) and all the results were about gum disease or forums where people put as the header ‘I lost my front teeth!’ So that’s terrified me even more. 

My gums seem fine, they don’t hurt, they aren’t red. They bleed when I brush sometimes but that’s when im really rough at brushing. If I’m gentle and brush properly, no blood. I’m so terrified I’m already acting like they’ve fallen out. Ive even been thinking that I wish they would just fall out at least then I could be like okay, so now I need to get this sorted. But the whole worrying that it might happen is a nightmare. I’ve been spending the past week either crying uncontrollably or sleeping so I don’t have to think about it. That is of course unless I have a dream where my teeth fall out which I dream about quite frequently. 

Sorry that this is so long. I’ve never really spoken about my HA before. Nobody ever seemed to get it and my doctor is in no way supportive or understanding, just acts like I’m annoying them. My family don’t get it either. My mum actually told me I was deranged when I was in the middle of an intense panic attack a few years back.

I went to the ER last week and they said the blood tests showed no signs of it being heart related but my PCP decided to have me wear a heart monitor patch for a week and that made me more conscious of my palpitations and pains. Today is first day since I’ve taken it off and sent it in. While I was eating lunch (normal meal that shouldn’t have triggered anything) I experienced hot flashes across my body and then the pains started again. Has anyone experienced similar symptoms? I’m a 24 male who is 6’,underweight and pretty malnourished right now from my stomach issues.

It’s genetics - my family has tons of moles, but today I noticed 2 more on my stomach, or maybe 1 new mole and a weird red dot? It’s making me extremely anxious.  

2 weeks ago I was in and out of the hospital for some strep throat complications which has completely peaked my anxiety.  I’m only 19 and I’m indoors most of the time and have no family history of Melanoma, but I can’t help but freak out. 

They’re very tiny, one is small and brown but the other may not even be a mole? It’s the same size, but red and not raised. No pain or itching. It’s just making me paranoid.

healthanxiety,StandardCaterpillar,2018/03/21,"Telling the difference between anxiety and something else? (Upper stomach / throat) So I've had these symptoms for more than a month now...getting close to 2 and I KNOW I'm freaking out about them. Earlier I felt like I couldn't breathe and something might be wrong with my heart and that got all checked out, got normal blood tests, everything was fine and I finally saw my primary care who said my anxiety seemed really bad. So I felt silly for getting over anxious and I have a therapy appointment and a meds appointment and everything to deal with my anxiety. So that's all set to be dealt with.

That said, everything started in my throat/upper stomach and that hasn't really been checked besides me going ""ahhh"" and doctor's looking down my throat (apparently it looked bad at first, but now looks fine). I'm having discomfort (and some mild pain) in a very specific area right under my breast in the center...front and back...the pain mostly in the back, and discomfort in the front. I burp every time I eat, I never burped before at all and the discomfort is worse when I eat and sometimes relieved when I burp. I have mild nausea. I have mucus in my throat, a white coating on my tongue. And this has been going on for the full 1 month +. 

I'm just not sure...is this just anxiety should I try to ignore it until my therapy appt? Is it indigestion or gas or acid reflux or something mild like that (the primary care guy suggested acid reflux, but I'm been trying various remedies for all this type of stuff and nothing seems to help)? Or should I ask to be checked? My doctor does have an electronic place where I can ask a question but I just feel silly since I KNOW my anxiety is bad and it might just be anxiety.

I see discomfort in this area can be related to like an ulcer or a hernia so I guess that would be my anxiety but mainly I just hate feeling so uncomfortable and having trouble eating so if there's any possibility it's physical I'd like to get it fixed!

Does anyone have any advice or similar experience?

EDIT: So here's what ended up helping my acute anxiety. 1) I stopped Googling. 2) I remembered that while I felt sure I had an ulcer I felt sure a few days ago that I had - anemia - thyroid problems -heart problems and I DID get tested for those...and they were all fine, so it's likely this would turn out fine too even though I FEEL so sure. 3) I distracted myself and tried to do something else.

healthanxiety,ijustneedareddit,2018/03/21,"Persistent pain in Fibrocystic breast - Anyone have similar experiences? A couple months ago I got a checkup because my breasts have always felt lumpy. Doctor felt with her hands and said they felt like normal lumpy breasts. I got an ultrasound and was told I have fibrocystic breasts. Cool! I could finally relax.


A month later, I literally woke up one day and felt a ""pain"" in my right breast I hadn't felt before. I don't know if ""pain"" is what I should use since it doesn't hurt too bad, but I can definately and specifically feel it, and it's a sensation I don't feel anywhere else in my breast.


Ever since it randomly started that day, months later, it is persistent and I still feel it in the same spot. I'll feel it ""twinge"" throughout the day. It hasn't been getting more painful, but it is a specific sensation in the same spot (although sometimes when I sleep it'll feel slightly painful/more pronounced in the morning, but then goes back to its ""normal"" sensation after I move around. It also hurts when I feel/knead it with my hands, but so do many other parts of my boobs).


During my cycle, my nipples will get sore a few days before my period, and then feel normal again once it starts - that is the way my breasts have acted during my cycle for years. This new specific sensation in my breast is persistant throughout the month, and I believe it's unrelated to my cycle.


Has anyone had similar experiences like this? Any advice, similar experiences, or concerns if something's going on with me that I should get checked out would be appreciated.

healthanxiety,ercarp,2018/03/21,"Worried I have worms in my brains, among other bizarre health anxieties. For the past several months I've been on a huge parasite scare that came out of seemingly nowhere. I even had stool samples taken (again, several months ago) and everything came back negative. But now I'm thinking maybe the samples weren't great. Apparently they do their testing kind of hastily sometimes, so I'm thinking of doing a second batch of samples.

Anyway... I always thought that tapeworms were just an intestinal parasite. But then I read that they can spread to other organs too, including your EYES and BRAINS. Christ. So, naturally, I look in the mirror every day to make sure there aren't any worms in my eyes. I also check my stool with every bowel movement. And now I'm worried that the larvae of this hypothetical worm has spread to my lungs (I've been coughing a lot lately) and brains as well (would explain my headaches, and why I feel so spaced out.)

I've also had to take my cat to the vet a couple times because she was diagnosed with diabetes, so naturally I'm worried about fleas as well now. I just saw some kind of small, brown bug on my floor (one of my cats spotted it) that bounced around a couple times before I killed it. Now, it could've just been a moth that was struggling to fly, but it could've also been a flea. Right? And infected fleas carry feline tapeworms that are even worse than regular tapeworms if they spread to humans.

So yeah, it's 3 AM and I'm going over all of this shit in my head, unable to sleep.

I guess I should mention I'm also worried about going blind, as my astigmatism has been getting worse (and I found out about something called keratoconus, which I may have) and I also have all kinds of pains in my body (around pancreas and liver, especially) so I could also have cancer. Or maybe those are just the cysts formed by the larvae of the tapeworm.

The thing I noticed is that it always gets worse and more intense during the winter months and beginning of spring. I get back pains, my joints start to ache, I feel tired,... which triggers unhealthy and irrational thoughts and anxiety about my health (for the last month I was absolutely sure I had heart problems, lung cancer, an aneurysm, and some other illnesses). It's absolutely crazy.

I don't know, but it's often this way. It always gets worse during the period of january - april. During summer and fall I sometimes get little health scares, but they're nowhere as intense as during the cold and darker months.

healthanxiety,iamanemotionaltampon,2018/03/22,"Having a difficult time managing my anxiety Hi everyone. This will probably be quite lengthy, so I’ll apologize in advance. I’ve been struggling for years with health related anxiety which I “managed” for a long time on my own. By manage, what I really mean is just deal and push through it. I’m at a point where it’s more than I can handle now and it’s crippling. 

My mother has had Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis for 21 years and I grew up watching her deteriorate from an independent, strong woman into someone who is now dependent on someone else for even the most basic tasks. I think this is the root of my health anxiety. 

I am terrified of getting MS. Over the last 4-5 years I’ve had varying degrees of symptoms ranging from tingling in hands and feet to constant headaches. I’ve had a number of tests done which all come back either normal, or with some other explanation. The most recent being a constant left sided headache and pain in my left eye. My primary care physician ordered an MRI based on my family history of MS which came back abnormal with some extremely small white spots which they were unable to make a diagnosis of. Their recommendation was to see a neurologist and get a lumbar puncture. This was in November...

I live in Massachusetts which makes me extremely fortunate to have access to some of the best hospitals in the country. I was able to schedule an appointment with a neuro at Mass General, currently #3 in the country for neurology. The doctor was extremely nice and listened to everything I had to say. He flat out said “I do not think you have MS”. He explained to me that MS has certain patterns that show in an MRI which mine did not show. He said he believes my headaches are being caused by a combination of tension from clenching my jaw at night, which I absolutely do, and migraines with aura, which has happened twice. I asked about the lumbar puncture and he told me if I really wanted one and if it would put my mind at ease, he would gladly order one, but he felt it would come back negative. 

I certainly do not want to put myself through that unnecessarily and I’m afraid it still wouldn’t placate me. He also completed a full neurological exam, which I passed. I left there feeling pretty relieved. That lasted for about an hour. I started thinking about what if he’s wrong?? He’s basically just assuming this is due to headaches, but he really doesn’t know for sure. 

I really don’t know what to do at this point. My anxiety is out of control and I can’t stop thinking about this. It consumes every thought of my day and it is exhausting. I hate feeling like this. I do have a NP Psych who I see every six months who is very nice and tries to prescribe medication for me, but I can never bring myself to take it. I read the side effects and they scare the crap out of me so much that I’m too scared to take them. The only thing I will take is Xanax, which usually isn’t often, but lately it’s been almost every day. 

I also see a therapist who also is very nice, but if I’m being honest, isn’t very helpful. Whether that is my own fault, I don’t know. I originally went to her because I have issues with control and wanted to try to work on that. I just don’t find it to be doing anything for me though... 

I just wish I knew how to RELAX my thoughts and stop being such a worry wart. I’m wound so tight I’m ready to snap at any given minute. I get up every day, shower, go to work and then come home and lay in bed until I fall asleep because I’m so exhausted. I don’t know if I’m exhausted because of my mental health, work hours, or if something is really physically wrong with me. 

I’m honestly not even sure what I’m looking for in writing this, maybe I just needed to vent. But if anyone can relate or offer any advice I would be open to hearing anything you have to say.

My current concern is with the brain eating amoeba. I spent time in a hot tub that wasn't properly chlorinated this weekend. Shortly after the hot tub, I got in the shower and ummm.. picked my nose rather vigorously. After doing so, I thought about the warm hot tub water, so I blew my nose then used saline spray to clean out my nostrils. 2 times in the last 3 days, I've gotten really dizzy and lightheaded, feeling like I was going to fall or pass out. Today, I've had a bad headache and have felt extra sensitive to light. No fever at this point. 

Allow me to think out loud:
- can the amoeba even enter the brain from picking your nose?
- is it possible that the amoeba would have just been in my nostril, then I helped it further up towards the brain with the stream of saline solution?
- would a headache associated with the amoeba come and go or be constant/progressively worse?

I know a much more effecting outlet would have been distracting myself or using other anxiety relieving techniques.. but I couldn't resist venting on here. I'm struggling!

healthanxiety,HulkSmash1978,2018/03/23,"Years of Random, Sudden, &amp; Violent Vomiting. Anyone Else Have Similar Experiences? I am wondering if anyone else has had similar symptoms and had any luck correcting it? 

I am 39, and have been suffering from random vomiting spells in the mornings for approximately 15 years. I have seen many doctors and specialists without any luck finding a cause. They have performed many tests and everything showed up negative or inconclusive.

It can come in waves but is fairly consistent. For the last two weeks I have thrown up 6 out of the 14 days (43% of the time). Sometimes it’ll be for a few days in a row, sometimes I can go a month without a spell and have experienced it multiple times daily for over a month at a time. The worst was about three times daily for a month and caused me to lose 45 lbs that month due to no appetite.

The majority of the time it happens in the mornings right after I wake up and before I get into the shower. It can happen throughout the day as well at random. It’s fast, uncontrollable, violent, and usually produced a white foamy substance. However, I had my gallbladder removed in November due to gallstones. That didn’t fix the problem and the docs thought it would. 

Ever sense the gallbladder removal all I throw up is yellow stomach bile. Today it went from yellow to a green color. After getting sick I usually have a pain of about a 4 out of 10 right in the middle of my torso. I find myself applying pressure with my hand to relieve the pain. Usually have to lay in the fetal position after a bad spell without an appetite until the end of the day or night. 

Some of the exams that have been done without luck is Celiac Disease, the breath test for H. Pylori, Barium Swallow test, upper Endoscopy, Colonoscopy, ultrasounds of my gallbladder &amp; liver, gallbladder removal, MRI brain scan for tumors.

Again it happens usually in the mornings, with gagging and dry heaving until something comes up. Usually there is no food or liquids other than the white foam and stomach bile. 

If anyone else has experienced similar symptoms and found relief please let me know.

healthanxiety,lanadelgay69,2018/03/23,"Same illness for two years in a row! Need advice Could be TMI but here it goes:

So, this started in March 2016. I started noticing that just before I peed, I felt a sting every time before I passed urine. This when on for 2-3 weeks, then I got really scared and when to the doctor. They prescribed a urine test and also prescribed some medicines for UTI. The results came back negative for a UTI. A couple of days later, I had a really upset stomach with nausea and my roommate had to take me to the hospital. And I mentioned to the doctor about my prior visit. He prescribed another urine test, checked my penis for any issues (I also felt some tightness in my foreskin). He couldn't find any issues. And this urine test came back negative too. I was starting to panic as I the situation was not getting better. So, I had to fly back home to see another doctor( i was in college btw). Another doctor, another urine test and the result: nothing, nada, zilch!
It was same for some more time and then I started feeling gassy along with the initial symptoms. I got prescribed some gas relief medicines and that was it. All in all, this went for couple more months, then the sting before peeing, gradually went away.

So now a little over a year later, in June 2017. The same symptoms returned. And the same progression of symptoms occurred: the stinging sensation, and few weeks later the gassiness etc. But it was worse this time around, I had a very bad heart attack scare with symptoms like pain in the chest, my left arm going completely numb and gassiness. So, I was rushed to the hospital where they performed an ECG. I had a fever too. They concluded that nothing was wrong with me. Oh yeah, I had another urine test a couple of days earlier and it was negative. Amidst all this chaos, I had to travel and it had a 32 hour travel time. So obviously I wasn't looking forward to it. And my nightmare came true. I finished that journey with constant gassiness, nausea and uneasiness. So, I guess I'm not in a hurry to ever take on that long a journey ever again in my life. So, these symptoms finally improved but painstakingly slowly: 4 months.

So, my concern now is that it gonna be April soon, that means I might get this stupid mysterious illness again. What do I do? I feel about 70% just might be my head which is causing all of this anxiety.

Also i feel I was misdiagnosed everytime. The doctors always brushed it off with, ""Your results are fine, don't worry about it.""

My boyfriend and I have been dating for over two years now and I always sorta joked about how he was a hypochondriac, but he’s shared some recent concerns with me and I’ve realized how severe his anxiety is behind it. A few weeks ago he was convinced he had ALS because of muscle twinges. Last night he shared with me that he’s terrified he has liver disease as a result of how much he used to drink in college. He gets down this long rabbit hole of searching through the internet and it drives me crazy because it’s not helping anything. And he refuses to get tested for anything because he doesn’t want it to be confirmed true. 

He has generalized anxiety on occasion and has started to go to a therapist but still hasn’t talked about these types of things with the therapist, which drives me crazy. We’re in our mid-twenties, live in a metropolitan area, and live a pretty healthy lifestyle, going to the gym frequently and eating semi-healthy. 

Im thinking about blocking sites like Mayo Clinic and webMD so he can’t search at home but I don’t know if that’s a mean thing to do.

healthanxiety,BinaryTsar,2018/03/24,"Post TC anxiety Hi all,

Just venting some steam off here.

So, last August I “found a lump,” I had a CT, an op to remove my left testicle and then on 02 October was officially diagnosed with Stage 2a Testicular Cancer. Since then I’ve had Chemo, Radiotherapy and as of a few weeks ago my first “Scans are normal” meeting with the Onco. Hooray!

That said, the health anxiety I’m experiencing is taking the piss. Every little ache, twitch, twinge, anything makes me worry unnecessarily.

As a result of the Radiotherapy my guts have been a bit iffy since, but a recent toothache caused me to take a lot of Ibuprofen, which together with the Radiotherapy caused me some really dire constipation. This lead to a hemorrhoid. It’s internal and normally I can’t feel it unless I’ve sat on something cold in which case it throbs for a few minutes and then stops. Occasionally there’s a spot or two of blood on my crap, and one occasion I had such a large bowel movement that it turned the toilet water bright, bright red, but otherwise my bms are consistent size, shape, colour and bloodless - they just scratch a little as they pass. I’m improving my diet to include more fibre so hopefully it’ll sort itself out.

Right now I want to concentrate on the future. I’ve been given a new lease of life,  but I feel that all the residual after effects are holding me back and the worry over everything my body does is becoming quite a burden.",6.28477585829871,7.05097191449814,7.07485676798601,72.5228165318172,65.914498141264,10.4929805379401,30.6934178876011

In my short time following, i have felt a sense of belonging here because all of you seem to really understand how it feels to deal with HA. For me it’s an stressful, frustrating, terrifying condition that leaves me paralyzed with fear and exhausted from sleepless nights of searching the internet for reassurance. I definitely get the temptation to post here looking for reassurance from each other that our symptoms are benign but let’s take some time to talk coping. I would love to know what you do to cope when the anxiety takes over. Perhaps we can help each other cope a bit instead of reassuring each other that we are healthy. 

I’ve shared my two tips before, the first is to allow myself a few moments a day to think about my worry. I give it space to exist without doing anything to correct it. I recognize that it’s there and then put it back on an imaginary shelf to visit again tomorrow. The rest of the day I do what I can to keep it there. Sometimes I even say “no, I’ll talk to you later!” (It’s worth noting that this strategy doesn’t always work but sometimes days go by and my anxiety has been kept at a manageable level.)

The other one is for full on panic attacks: I pick out 3 things I can hear, smell, see, and if possible, taste. Sometimes doing this mindful activity can give my brain/body the space to rest for a moment.... long enough to calm down a bit. 

Anything work for you?

healthanxiety,dc_bs,2018/03/25,"Reassurance Hello,

I stumbled upon this subreddit about two weeks ago and since then have been reading it often to help cope with my health anxiety. I often end up laughing at myself over my anxiety. This is my first post and rather lengthy. I apologize. 

My most recent concern is that I have some sort of colon cancer. I have been having unusual bowel movements for several months. Changes in appearance, size, etc. Sorry, too much information. I mentioned it to my doctor earlier this month and he shrugged it off and said to try Miralax. I did, but didn’t notice much difference aside from change in color and more loose. 

I’ve recently thought I’ve noticed some red streaking in the stool which has elevated my anxiety about the situation. My employment offers a telemedicine service so I called and spoke to a doctor about my concerns and he said it’s likely IBS and promised I was fine. I follow up with my doctor again this past week and he said the risk is slim for anything major but referred me to a gastro doctor. The appointment isn’t until next month. 

This weekend, I decided it would be a good idea to get an EZ Detect test which tests for blood in the stool. These are little pieces of paper you put in the toilet after a bowel movement that changes to blue or green if blood is detected. You are first supposed to put a paper in to test the water color. I decided to skip that step and test my first bowel movement yesterday late afternoon/early evening. There was no color change on the paper. I was satisfied. 

This morning I decide to do the water test to eliminate any what ifs from my mind. Once again, there was no color change. I follow the water test with another bowel movement. There was no color change. 

There is a control test you are supposed to do at the end to verify that the paper worked properly. It comes with a powder that changes the color of the paper. I flush everything and pour the powder in and then place the paper in for the control test and it instantly turns blue. 

About an hour or two later I feel another bowel movement coming on and I decide to use my final test. The paper instantly turns a very faint blue and I immediately freak out. About 5-10 minutes later I realized that I had put the powder in the toilet and that it’s possible there was some left over in the water even after flushing. I have noticed some little white specks in that toilet throughout the day today. 

I just am looking for some reassurance that there was likely a little bit of left over powder and that my health anxiety is getting the best of me, as usual.",4.75305177403795,6.53047301832994,5.43088058741559,79.1396835137743,70.3441955193483,8.10121127666417,27.7886697395219

Last month, I got hit with bronchitis hard. Couldn't breathe, chest was heavy, fever, hacking, the whole works. Around that time my stomach would be hurting after exercise or drinking a lot of wine or taking ibuprofen but I didn't think much of it, it always went away after awhile, and was t that bad. 
After the antibiotics, my chest was better, but my throat was still swollen. I ended up getting a raw piece  potato stuck in my throat (didn't chew it well enough) and had to get an endoscopy to push it down. Since then, I've had some of the worst acid reflux from my esaughagus being swollen, but nexium and tums seemed to help...until this morning. 

I drank a couple cups of coffee, to my multivitamin, and about and hour afterwards my stomach began hurting again. It felt like a knife stabbing me 1000 time in my upper abdomen. I planned on walking to the e.r., but I had to stop and rest at the police station, where they seen me sweating pofusely, breathing hard, and pale and called an ambulance. I'm there for three hours. My white cell count came back fine, as did my hemoglobin and everything else. She said before I left ""you may have an ulcer brewing down there but only your GI can go and look for sure"". I was released with a antacid and zophran.

Well like a dumbass, I sat down and Google my symptoms of an ulcer. Started reading about puforated abdomen and began freaking out . I tried to smoke some green to calm down, as it worked before, and had some vague pain in my lower right side. Since I am my own biggest asshole, I absent/stoner mindly put ""lower right abdomen pain"" thinking it was gonna say ulcer and reinforce what I believe without solid proof....aaaand guess what it says first? Appendicitis. I still have my appendix (not my galbladder), and boy, THAT was a dumb idea to google. I shut down my home screen and put in some gtaV and tried to veg out on that. It worked temporarly.

 I have to call my GI in the morning, and I keep telling myself I'm probably just tripping out and blood tests dont lie, but there's that though in the back of your head that keeps your heart racing.

healthanxiety,HokutoSilver,2018/03/26,"Anxiety -&gt; ... -&gt; tender neck muscle To start, I've been going through a lot of health anxiety the last few months. I've never actually felt sick or anything, but this basically stems from getting fixated on swallowing/hyperawareness for months on end. 

It started out as if it might be tmj pain, but recently it was tongue pain, mostly when swallowing, for a few weeks. After I finally went to a dentist, assuming I must be scraping it on sharp teeth or something, they weren't able to find anything wrong. That has since eased off, I assume because my anxiety about it relaxed, but now it's more focused on a tender spot that seems to be on my scm muscle...which I saw can be a cause of swallowing pain.

The upper front end, just below the corner of my jaw, spanning about a half-inch. It feels as if it's bruised or something, and it seems to be super tender to the touch. I don't feel any strange lumps/lymph nodes, and my salivary gland above it feels fine, it seems to be part of the muscle or a tendon in there. Pretty close to the surface. I've read that trigger points in the digastric might be involved, causing ""pseudo-scm pain"" but it's been driving me crazy. I've also been feeling a lot of tension around the upper shoulders. 

So I wanted to just see if this all sounds like a reasonable idea of what's happening, and if anyone's got some advice. It's super irritating and it's really hard to take my mind off the tenderness.

Never considered the possibility of cancer.

- I'm young, 23, so I know I have the odds in my favor here as far as likelihood goes
- Itchy butt (it seems to start near my colon, but itches all the way up my crack and on my cheeks; this is why I initially thought it was a yeast infection); comes and goes depending on carb intake &amp; stress
- Just recently, I had some bad diarrhea and have been obnoxiously gassy since (for about the last week); farting is basically incessant
- Stools have normalized for the most part since, I'll have some hearty ones (the type you're proud of), sometimes some thinner ones, no additional diarrhea
- During the aforementioned diarrhea episode, there was some blood when I wiped (bright red, I seemed to come directly in contact with the ""source"" while wiping so not sure if that's a hemorrhoid or a polyp?); no blood in stool though
- Also, the itchy butt started after having sex w a girl I dated a few months ago (did an STD screening, negative)

What worries me is just the combo of the incessant gas + itchy burning butt + blood

I will start by saying that our water has a decent amount of chlorine as far as I can tell, it's the only thing you can taste in the water, and if you fill a bathtub it's even ever so slightly green. There's never been an order to boil water or anything of the sort either here.

So moving onto story time. I often get itchy eyes before bed, so I keep a glass of water in the bathroom, that way I can rinse my eyes out quickly to calm things down, the glass of water had probably been out for a few hours, anywhere from 6- 12. Last night I did it, and as the water ran down my face a little bit got in my nose, maybe a drop or 2 tops. I started freaking a minute later as I remembered all I'd read about fowleri.... I blew my nose a bunch, and I rolled up some toilet paper, and stuck it up my nostril as well in an attempt to deal with any water that had made its way up there. I spent a terrified hour in bed reading things on my phone, and eventually calmed down enough to sleep.

Now all day today I haven't had a fever or anything of the sort, but I have been getting sinus headaches. (Quite possibly from blowing my nose so much) And I got rather paranoid in the shower too, anytime water got near my nose, or even the tiniest bit might have entered I freaked out a bit. My right nostril which is the one the water entered is also worse than the left, but the discomfort might just be from me freaking out and blowing it a ton... I have bad sinuses at the best of times, so it could just be dust or allergies too.

I know I'm probably being silly, but some confirmation would be lovely, especially since the glass of water, while cold was sitting out a long time... A day of sinus headaches just doesn't exactly fill me with confidence, even if it probably was cause I wouldn't leave things alone. One last thing to note is that 2 family members of mine recently had colds, so that might be why I'm feeling crappy sinus wise too, the right side being worse than the left still has me all freaked out though.",5.96506849315069,5.38589035844749,6.34485159817352,82.0783732876712,66.648401826484,8.94383561643836,29.8938356164384
healthanxiety,Bob_Majerle,2018/03/29,"A great, simple technique for coping with health anxiety (I posted this as a comment to another thread about panic attacks, but thought it warranted its own post. It's adapted for anxiety from a similar method in *Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy*, a book on depression by David D. Burns, M.D.)

***************

If you struggle with health anxiety (or any kind of anxiety really), give this a try the next time your worries start to get the better of you. I do it in an Excel spreadsheet, but a notebook works fine too.


**The Three-Column Technique**
 


**Column 1: Fear**
 
In this column, write down whatever's freaking you out at the moment: ""I'm worried I'll have a heart attack out of nowhere"" or ""What if someone took what I said at yesterday's meeting the wrong way?""

**Column 2: What triggered it**
 
Write down what you were thinking, feeling or doing when you started down your current worry spiral. For example, ""I felt a skipped heartbeat"" or ""I felt my lymph nodes and they seemed a little swollen."" Over time, some triggers will appear more often in your notes than others, helping you spot habits that get you into trouble.

**Column 3: Real talk**
 
Normally, you only think of the worst-case scenario. This is your chance to do the opposite: write down every reason you can think of that you'll be absolutely fine - which, by the way, are *exponentially more realistic scenarios*. Go nuts; the more you write, the better you'll feel. 

For example, my scariest symptoms are skipped heartbeats, so when I feel one, I list points like these:


 * Skipped heartbeats are perfectly normal; most people have them and don't even notice


 * Some people experience thousands of skipped beats a day and are perfectly healthy


 * You already met with a cardiologist, and she gave you a clean bill of health


 * Skipped beats are a very common side effect of anxiety - it's much more likely anxiety is the cause than some rare heart defect


 * This aside, I have zero symptoms of an underlying heart issue


  ...and on and on.

 
The more you use this technique, the more you'll notice the same fears and triggers popping up over and over again. And when you see that, you'll see how often you worry about the same thing - and how your worst fears are never, ever realized.

 
Hope this helps, stay strong!",1.9979874353289,4.80577146097561,2.63321507760532,87.2482335550629,94.1463414634146,5.21655580192166,23.2852919438285

healthanxiety,throwawayme84,2018/03/29,"As someone who has recovered from health anxiety, I want to reiterate how true the pinned post about reassurance is u/nathan98900 has posted some excellent advice about how reassurance feeds health anxiety. If you are not hypochondriac and you get stressed due to a chest pain, then yes, reassurance will work for you and you will get on with your life. But if you are hypochondriac, since your mind is in ""worry-mode,"" when you are reassured about one of your symptoms, yes you will feel temporary relief, but it is very likely you will probably find something new to worry about. I was sick and tired of worrying about every single symptom and spending a fortune on dozens of doctors. So one day I decided that I will stop caring about my symptoms and stopped googling and got on with my life no matter what. Then for a few weeks my symptoms and anxiety become worse, almost unbearable. Of course they would be. My anxious mind had got used to the instant gratification from reassuarance seeking and was begging for that. But I had said to myself that I would keep myself busy and distracted no matter how anxious I was and ignore my symptoms no matter how much panic I had. Then, something very logical happened. My mind decided that since I am not reacting to all these symptoms, then they must not be that serious. So it could take some time off and relax and not worry anymore. Then anxiety slowly dissipated and along with that all these symptoms that I thought could give me a diagnosis of 20 extra rare fatal diseases went away as well. 

Also remember that almost all people recover. You do not see that in this sub, because people that recover do not come back to post. You may feel hopeless now, but it is certain that you will be fine eventually once you find what works for you. This is what worked for me btw:

healthanxiety,Apollomajor,2018/03/29,"Worried ive had cancer and its progressed too far now undiagnosed I apologize in advance for my sloppy writing. Im a 19 year old male, and 18 last year when i started experiencing my symptoms. It was June or july 2017 and i had been starting to feel tired more often as my senior year ended. Nothing shocking since ive always been tired and i was losing sleep over stress of not knowing where i was gonna go for college or how i was gonna spend the summer. One day in the summer when i was hanging out with my cousin i became unbareably tired and felt like i was gonna pass out. Id describe it just as the feeling of having really low blood sugar. I layed in my bed and freaked out because i thought i had something terribly wrong with me, my parents didnt take it seriously but instead talked very gently through it with me about how it was probably my anxiety and that did bring me back to feeling somewhat less fatigued after a rational conversation. I thought this feeling would go away during that week for sure, but i felt fatigued the whole week through. Being alone bored fatigued and scared to death that whole week took such a toll on my anxiety and stress levels. After that week i started to attempt to move past it, getting out and doing more physical things to try to shake it off and to also test that my physicallity wasnt degrading. Im not very fit and was never good at running but i wasnt physically diminished at all, i could run for just as long and do just as many pushups despite feeling a vague fatigue. After that it was on and off but it always came back, a sensation if vague fatigue and low blood pressure that would just strike me randomly. I went to the doctor a month later and all of my vitals were normal and he brushed it off as anxiety and stress related. I also wanted a blood test, which returned as completely normal. So i was just living like this, being constantly fatigued on and off. I eventually went back to him in august to try and get more answers but with good vitals yet again he wouldnt listen to my concerns and kept telling me it was psychological. I had another blood test which came back completely normal. Probably around september i started focusing on my bowel habits and noticed sometimes my food was indigested. So i thought hey, either colorectal cancer or ibs is behind this. I got a stool test done which came back completely normal. Now comes the beginning of this year and im still feeling frustrated by my off and on fatigue without any answers, so i try talking to a new gastro doctor because im still focused on having colorectal cancer. This doctor actually listens to everything i say and he suggests adding fiber to my diet. He asks me if i wanted a colonoscopy but i say no because im afraid to have one and we have poor insurance (which is possibly the most annoying aspect of this whole thing because whenever i visit the doctor which yields nothing my moms stuck with a bill that almost always goes into collections) anyway, i voice the concern that i might have celiacs disease because i have many food allergies as it is. I get a blood test done in late january checking for sprue and some cancer markers because i voiced my concern. Still completely normal and its not celiacs.  Here we are in march and my worries at an all time high. Its literally all i can think about. Made so much more troubling by the fact that over the past week ive been off balance on and off.

6 or 7 years ago, I felt a huge discomfort around my abdominal belt, so much that almost had to sleep standing up because it was the most confortable position for me, I went to a doctor and he shoved his hand in my lower stomach so hard I screamed in pain, he said it was appendicitis even though the pain was coming from him and him only, and he rushed me to the hospital. After a day of stress they announce me that i'm fine and that I just have to take some medication because there was a problem with my nose for some reason.

Because of that experience, any small tingling sensation in my stomach puts me in a state of anxiety, my heart rushed, i feel heat around my head, I want to throw up and I have diarrhea, which are common symptoms for appendicitis, so i end up in a vicious circle.

I've been suffering from anxiety and depression for a while now, and i'm pretty inactive at the moment, I'm a lot on my computer but ever since too weeks i've been feeling stomach discomfort for sitting too long, which triggered my anxiety through the roof and messed up my digestive system, going from constipation to diarrhea every few days, I also suffer from lower back pain.

Everyone is also so kind and helpful to one another, which is even more reassuring.

I've always had a little bit of health anxiety since I was a child (e.g. thinking I have appendicitis when I have a pain in my right lower stomach), but for the past several months, I have been in constant panic mode. It all started when I went to the ENT in December, she removed the wax from my ears (which I've had done before), and then a few days later I had intense ringing in my ears, a clogged feeling in my right ear, headaches, and dizziness. I was googling like crazy, which made things even worse. That ringing and googling led to, what I now know were panic attacks in which I was feeling disconnected from the world and having episodes of shaking, like the chills, amongst other symptoms. Long story short and countless ENT visits later where they didn't find anything wrong with me, I then went to the dentist who said I most likely had a TMJ disorder as a result of grinding my teeth, which I thought would make me feel better. But obviously, it didn't, and I just started to get different symptoms instead. 

I have been having a random ""tic"" in my neck in which it will randomly slightly jerk my head. Sometimes I get a little spazz in my leg or my arm as well, and a twitch that will last for a second or two in random body areas. I also have like a ""shaky"" feeling on the inside, which will sometimes lead to my fingers or toes being a little trembly. I recently have been getting floaters in my eyes, which I'm not sure if I've always had them and just never noticed, or if it's something new (my vision has been bad for years). Also, I randomly have ""visual snow,"" which I think I've also had for a while, but was never really concerned about until now. I feel like I am so hyper focused on my body and I just don't know how to get out of this phase.

I am only 23 and I feel like I am going crazy. I'm in my last year of grad school right now, and currently doing an internship in a hospital for speech pathology. So, not only am I at a super stressful time in my life, but I am around these disorders such as ALS, Parkinson's, MS, etc, and the fact that I see these disorders frequently, makes me even more nervous because they can really happen to anyone! I am caught between that ""1st year medical school"" syndrome thing and going to the doctor to see if there is something to actually be worried about.

I was at a bar talking to some women when we had to run my cousin back across the street to the hotel due to him getting into arguments. When we came back there were shots on the table for us and I really remember almost nothing after that.

Woke up at the lady's house the next morning and she dropped me off at my car. I've talked to her since and she's the guy did kiss me when we dropped him off. She said “you did get out to piss at one point and he followed you out. Don't know what happened but you were only gone about 45 seconds and didn't say anything when you got back in”.

That was last Friday night/Saturday morning. It's not Sunday and I have been sick as fuck. Sore throat, head stuffed up, probably one of the worst coughs I've ever had. Obviously the first thing that comes to mind to me is HIV. As far as I've been told from her nothing happened that night aside from the kiss part. I have since noticed that the condom from my wallet is gone but that honestly could have been gone for awhile before hand. I may have just forgotten to replace it. I would think if anything else happened I would be a bit sore the next day. I obviously know nothing about this person so their status would be unknown to me.

I know the general consensus will likely be that I am being overly anxious. But I know that I will not be able to calm down until I can be tested.

healthanxiety,ska1234567890,2018/04/01,"My Health Anxiety Symptoms Hi Everyone! 

As someone who has been struggling with health anxiety for the last 4 years, I have found the acknowledgment of potential anxiety symptoms to be the most reassuring form of support. This is not only reassuring to me as it reminds me of all of the different ways anxiety might affect your body, it also reminds me (and hopefully others) that many of these symptoms quickly pass, as they are only manifested *only* as a result of mental illness. 

Here's all of the symptoms that have come and gone as a result of my health anxiety. I hope that people may relate, and be reassured. I've bolded those symptoms which have remained more constant throughout the last 4 years. 

1. tingling extremities 

2. **cold hands and feet**

3. muscle spasms (mostly in leg, thought it was a blood clot, it was not) 

4. **tightness of muscles** particularly around neck and shoulders 

5. dry mouth

6. **bruxism**

7. chest pain, stabbing 

8. **chest pain, dull/achey** 

9. constipation/diarrhea (thought this was hypothyroidism, it wasn't) 

10. hair loss (thought this was PCOS, it wasn't) 

11. Paralysis like symptoms (this came in two ways. One: overthinking things that should be unconscious-- me, thinking about swallowing, resulted in my temporary inability to swallow liquid. Two: mid panic attack, thought I could not move legs. 

12. **pelvic, vaginal/vulva pain** (thought this was vulvar cancer, literally got a chunk cut out of my vulva to test. As soon as results came back negative, the pain stopped)

13. **headaches**

14. **HEADACHES**

15. **pressure in head, tightness** 

16. insomnia 

17. **lethargy**

18. difficulty concentrating 

19. hearing phantom ringing (always hearing my alarm clock, even when it's not going off) 

20. jitters

That is all! (I think). I hope this helped someone, please feel free to ask any questions. ",2.30780362687306,4.3697068658147,2.94335328263511,81.8121797237097,111.332268370607,5.72504162354317,28.3701120460784

I am a 29 year old female with two kids ages 6 and 11, I have had this illness since I was around 6.

To keep things, I will have random spasms across the abdomen with a sense of feeling hungry at night. Sometimes dull pain will be there and I belch often enough. I can get gassy but it is not prominent.

It isnt a burning pain and it doesnt interrupt my sleep. I will feel nauseous after eating at times but not always.

Stools are fairly normal. Light brown that sinks.

No vomitting as of yet. Fatigue nothing out of the ordinary. I will feel some sort of ache on the breastbones, arms and knees but the latter two not every day.

I will have lower back pain - but only at my job that requires a lot of standing and easily relieved with exercise. I do not have back pain at home or when moving. Only by standing at work

So I constantly worry about losing intelligence; I’m a pretty bright guy but I often worry that this attribute is slipping away from me.  I’m rather insecure about this.

I work at a swimming pool that’s under construction.  There were diesel fumes in the pool the whole 3 hour shift.  They were bad enough at one point to give a coworker a headache, and at least one patron turned right around when she came in and smelled how and it was.  Mgmt didn’t close till the last 30 mins!  I was one of the last on the deck.  Didn’t really get a headache, though.  Anyway I own a juul, I was using that before and after.  So nicotine exposure.  Haven’t used it for a few days.  Also I drank a bit with friends the night of that work shift.  Continued using the juul and drank more the night of the next day.  Also I was at higher altitude for two days after this, but only 2000 ft higher than the 5000 of my hometown.  Back home and still feel what I’m about to describe.  

I feel like my memory has been shitty since this, and my mental/cognitive/linguistic abilities down.  I feel dull.  I’ve had scares like this before, but this feels different.  Is this just anxiety? Anxiety seems to cause very real physical symptoms for me, but I feel less stressed than I normally would during this type of episode.  Anyone have any words of advice?  

EDIT: Forgot a MAJOR component: I got a meningitis vaccine the day before the second drinking incident.  Not an antivaxer at all, I just was worried about the interactions between all these in relation to my memory/mental issues recently.

Male

No previous health issues and no medications

I purchased an older vehicle from Alabama (I live in northern Illinois) on March 3rd, 2018. It was shipped that day and arrived March 6th, 2018. On March 25th, 2018 I opened up the engine cover (It is a van) and discovered a large amount of broken nuts or acorns and what looked like mouse droppings (small, round pellets about the size of rice) on top of the engine, along with a few chewed wires. I’m assuming that at some point this van sat for a period of time (not sure if recently before purchase, but I assume not, as there are was no sign of a current infestation to the previous owner prior to purchase). Anyway, fast forward to me cleaning it out a few days ago with a regular household vacuum. I don’t believe I used a respirator (mask) for all of the time, but if I did it was a 3$ one that is made for basic things like sanding, not for chemicals or pathogens. I vacuumed it up for quite awhile, probably about an hr. My question is, am I at risk for hantavirus? It seems that the virus wouldn’t survive after excretion for very long, and assuming that the mice were active until the very day that the van was picked up in Alabama (unlikely), there still would’ve been about 2.5 weeks between then and when I first opened up the engine compartment, and another week or so until I vacuumed it up. Any knowledge or experience with this? Lifespan of hantavirus after excretion? I’m killing my self over this and my anxiety is giving me a bunch of “symptoms”. Thank you in advance!

I've also had a feeling of tightness in my throat. I've been on allergy medication but it hasn't really helped.

When I wake up, I am fine. 2 hours later I know that I am going to die in a couple of weeks. It never ever fucking goes away. 
Being a hypochondriac, is going to either kill me from some fucking disease or it's going to make me kill myself. I have
tried getting help from the psychiatric ward, and I was actually seeing a therapist for a couple of weeks before they said 
that before we can go on I have to start taking my ADHD medication again. I said ""Ok fine"" thinking that it would only be a couple
of weeks before I could continue with the therapy sessions. It has now been over 3 months since I was in a session. It always keeps on getting
postponed because a doctor quit or that ""there are many people waiting for a psychiatrist"". I am so fucking tired of waiting, so fucking tired of 
worrying about disease X and disease Y. 
The first time I started experiencing problems was this autumn. I went abroad and as soon as I landed I got a lot of problems with my stomach. 
Constipation, dihareea. When I got back home I went to see a doctor who did a shit load of tests on me. Couldn't find a single problem with me
other than possible lactose intolerance. So I went to another doctor who said it was most likely IBS. After a couple of weeks the problems went
away, until I was more or less completely normal. Then I noticed I started loosing weight. My thoughts automatically went to a number of horrible 
diseases. I started eating more, and stopped taking my daily walks. (Which I started because I was told it was good for anxiety). 
When my dad came to visit the latest batch of problems started showing up. A lump in the throat. It feels like I have something
stuck in my throat that I am trying to swallow all of the time. It's not present the first couple of hours after I wake up, but after a while
it sets in. So I went to the doctor today and described my issue, and after an examination including blood tests and some stick in the throat
tests, he said that he could not see anything. He mentioned ""Globus"", and I have read that that is connected with anxiety. I just can't seem
to get it into my head that it is that and not something else. This is where I am at the moment.
I am so tired of this constant worry all of the time, and I am so tired of going to the doctor every other week trying to figure out 
if I am going to die next month or not. It is so fucking exhausting...
The only medicine I have at the moment is Promethazine for my anxiety, and I don't really know if it is helping or not. I guess it helps a little, 
but only for a couple of hours.

I know it's gross, but I've noticed what I would call a significant change in my stool within maybe the last year.

I think that's kind of normal, since I'm a 24-year-old female and I know my metabolism has to slow down at some point, but I feel uncertain about it. 

On top of that, I have noticed a little bit of blood in my stool. I've have had trouble with hemorrhoids in the past, so I'm pretty positive that's got to be what the blood is coming from. 

On top of THAT, I've also noticed an increasing amount of mucus in my stool, which I feel like my body may be producing to make up for my possible constipation.

healthanxiety,areyoureadyable,2018/04/04,"Relapse Advice Hello, Fellow Hypochondriacs! 

I've had severe health anxiety for a couple of months beginning around August last year. Panic attacks, pulse checking, spending way too much at the doctor's office, the whole shebang. 

Around February, I got on top of my shit and turned a leaf. My therapy, healthy eating, and exercise finally kicked in and I was literally like a new person. The health anxiety dissipated and I was able to function. 

But, after a dizzy spell over easter and a whole bunch of stomach problems from eating too many things I'm intolerant to, I've had a major relapse. I'm back to not sleeping, I can feel my heartbeat constantly, I'm Googling non-existent symptoms and struggling to function again. I'm hoping this is just a temporary relapse, a speed hump in what has otherwise been a pretty linear recovery.

I'll try to make my story as quick as possible. I've been working out for about 9 year now. I've battled forms of anxiety and depression my whole life. My health anxiety has been at an all time worst this past month. About a month and a half ago I took performance enhancing drugs (PEDS). I stopped cold turkey after taking them for 12 days cause I saw some symptoms I didn't like. Ever since I've stopped, my panics and anxiety have been killing me. My biggest fear is that I screwed up my heart just from those 12 days. 

I don't really fear anything else except for heart issues. I haven't been able to sleep since I've been in fear. I went to my doctor and she gave me all the physical tests (took my blood pressure, listened to my heart/breathing and checked my limbs for swelling) and she said everything seemed fine.

Yesterday I returned to the gym and working out makes me so nervous. I keep thinking any type of physical exertion is gonna cause my heart to stop. One symptom I've noticed is that I feel a weird bubbly feeling stemming from my upper left abdomen, sort of where my chest meets my stomach and it feels like a weird pressure/bubble rising through my stomach/chest and throat on the left side. It's almost like I have to burp but can't. I noticed its been happening and its mostly when I workout. I'm super scared that I have AFib. Hoping this is just anxiety related or stomach related.

healthanxiety,iphone1234567891011,2018/04/07,"Swelling under ""Xiphoid process"", results in mental issues and gastrointestinal tract issues Hello,

I am 27 years old male. I am a lonely guy that drinks a lot of beer. I drink only beer intentionally, so that the harm of alcohol is less. 


Recently, however this is still becoming an issue. I let my alcohol addiction to beer to overrule my healthy life. I smoke a lot of cigarrettes and I drink beer every day. I also drink so much coffee. My life is good, but recently I feel this anxiety. My overall performance is getting lower too.


A few months ago I noticed that I have swelling exactly bellow my ""Xiphoid process"". It is something internal. I have Gastrointestinal tract issues. I feel stomache discomfort, as well as drifting issues regularly. I researched about symptoms and could not get any information about it...

Recently I feel a lot of anxiety and it is messing my decisions and mental health already. I think this could turn into dementia or something serious. It could be a cancer, as well, I don't know.


I could have possibly gone to a doctor, but the problem is that I come from a poor family and owe around 500 euro for health care, which I cannot spend at this point. 

I hope you guys could help me identify the possible reasons for all this, so I can make some adequate response to it.. And I will see a doctor soon probably. I am just a bit scared and unaware of what I did to myself. 


Hope you guys support me and give me advice, Thanks!

**EDIT;** Also, I have been very anxcious around people ever since child. Every time I talk to someone, I feel something like pain in my stomache and have to make effort for all my conversation. I ended up a quiet and lonely guy because of it. This is the whole reason I abuse alcohol, cigarrettes and coffee. I wanted to overcome something psychological to be more connected. This abuse was obviously affecting my digestive system or something.. i don't know. I know that this will become a nightmare and could possibly be the reason for my death some day.

**Edit:** sorry, I am actually 30 years old male. I am so embarrased right now. 

**TLDR:** Swelling under ""Xiphoid process"", anxiety, mental disorder due to beer abuse and smoking

healthanxiety,dfrizado,2018/04/07,"Sick of taking anxiety medication ast year I was paralyzed on my left side due to a lesion on my brainstem. I recovered thankfully and learned to walk, talk and eat again. I have documented the last 15 months since being discharged. I have tried different medications (a lot) for my residual symptoms. Equilibrium and gait issues, depression and anxiety, cognitive issues and most importantly my severe neuropathy. If I didn’t take my medicine I was so itchy and uncomfortable I would be clawing at my feet and legs and actually leaving pretty big cuts. I was losing my train of thought and having trouble finding certain words. I have been in the medical neurology field since I was 19, I’m 34 now. I know about medical issues and treatments and all of them have such a negative impact on daily life. I had to make a change. I started taking CBD oil and weaned myself off all my meds. I feel great. My thinking has improved. My speaking skills are on point now. I am no longer losing bits and pieces of a conversation. I wish I did this sooner. Like I said I recovered, but I was left with a lot of symptoms, things that my grandparents are complaining of and even though I’m only 34 this is my life now. I can’t go on the rest of my life taking pills everyday. So now I take CBD oil in the morning and at night. I started out slowly and gradually increased it. I decided to start selling it to get a discount on my monthly oils. Im not a sales person but if I can benefit from this, I am sure other people in the same boat as me could too.

healthanxiety,secret_cuttle,2018/04/07,"Struggling to discern between anxiety and ""real"" symptoms How does anyone manage to deal with health anxiety, when you clearly have symptoms of something and it isn't just a general worry about dropping dead from cancer or a stroke? 

A couple of weeks ago I noticed I had ""air hunger"", that sensation that you aren't getting enough oxygen and I have begun to get vertigo / dizzy or lightheadedness quite frequently. Here in the UK it is quite hard to get a Dr's appointment that isn't an emergency one and I have got one booked in for close to the end of the month. The last week has been horrible for me, because while realistically as a 29 year old I am not at a huge risk of lung cancer or heart failure and I cannot stop obsessing about how serious this illness could potentially be. Especially because it is clearly not a common cold, but if it is real maybe a viral infection like labyrinthitis. The problem is that the more I worry, the more things happen like palpitations, stomach ache and such like. All classic anxiety symptoms that I am sure are due to my HA, but my mind just cannot reconcile that the simplest explanation must be true. Its the opposite of how i operate as I am a scientist and normally think very logically. 

In the past I have spoken to the GP about my HA, but they don't really seem to do much about it. I asked if I could be refereed to someone, but instead was told to look up self-help related stuff online. Weirdly, I worry that being labelled as a hypochondriac on my medical records will bias a doctor towards me if I am require treatment.

My HA started 6 years ago, when I fell ill, had a number of tests on my head and heart over the course of a few weeks. During this time, I convinced myself I was dying - too many different ailments to list.
I started having panic attacks, usually when in a crowded area, that were debilitating.

healthanxiety,powellax18,2018/04/08,"Pressure on head likely due to stress and anxiety, but knowing this doesn't make it go away. Hey everybody, 

20 yo Male here.

To give a little rundown for the past year or so whenever I have any sort of problem with my body I tend to assume the worst and can't stop thinking about the issue until I get 100% confirmed of the problem and that it is solvable. A good representation of this was in December I thought I was having heart palpitations, and it really stressed me out. Long story short and a few doctors visits later, I had an ultrasound of my heart, and I passed with flying colors, where there were no signs of any problem with my heart. After that day, my heart did not flutter once and hasn't really since because if I ever start to get to that point, I remember the ultrasound and how good it was, and the problem will cease. 

More recently however, my lower right abdominal was hurting and after some googling (which I know is bad for me but I still do anyway) I believed it could be appendicitis. So I did my classic worrying and got some bloodwork done and a CT scan, and there was classically no issue to worry about. A few days later with some medication, the gut problems went away, but then I had my first nosebleed in a few years. I live in upstate New York, so this should not be an uncommon thing, but it spiraled into something very aggravating.

This is where we address my current issue, which is a pressure on my head that is likely some sort of tension headache. The pain level in my head is extremely low, probably around a 1, but I can tell all the muscles in my neck/shoulders are now tense. I have been doing my classic Googling, and I'm certain that all these symptoms I have been getting are solely due to anxiety and stress, but knowing that isn't taking away any of the tension in my head. This problem has caused me to have trouble falling asleep, making me wake up in the middle of the night, and waking up much earlier than I would want to. Last night it felt as though I just laid there and didn't sleep at all, but I'm sure I likely did. I am now on a more or less sleep schedule of trying to go to bed around 1 am, not being able to until 2:30 am, then rising for morning at about 7:30 am. This whole process is likely what is causing my stress, but is also something that is tough to conquer due to my stress. I have started to work out recently, and usually after hitting the gym I am feeling ""normal"" for a little while, but right when I wake up my symptoms manifest and it's back to this anxious version of myself.

I am not sure what I am hoping to come of writing this, maybe I just want someone to tell me that what is happening is solely due to my stress/anxiety so I can affirm that even further. Or, maybe I want somebody to reciprocate with me and tell me they went through the same thing, and let me know how they got through it. Right now it just seems like a constant cycle that is very tough to break, but I'm hopeful for the future.

Hope everyone has a great day, and thanks for any help.",7.31032668881506,6.07810852657808,7.36822591362126,77.9769678848284,64.2325581395349,10.0864673311185,35.1829457364341

She described what happened during the stroke and it is absolutely terrifying. She said hat she was feeling fine and then all of a sudden the right side of her body was paralyzed. She couldn’t even speak or make out any words. 

After listening to that, I started freaking out immediately. I’ve always been struggling with anxiety and panic attacks and now this story reignited those fears.

They removed it, but he went through a lot of stress and is still taking injections everyday. 
 After this, me as a person suffering from anxiety, got to live with this fear, that there might be something in me, that i might not be aware of. And even when i have a headache or something like that, fear kicks in.

healthanxiety,StarShot77,2018/04/09,"Heart Disease, depression, anxiety, and stress This semester I am taking Abnormal Psychology. One of the chapters I had the misfortune of reading was on the physical health effects of negative emotions, something I am chocked full of. Whether its stress, anxiety, depression, anger/frustration, I show it. My mood bounces around a lot. 

Even at my young age of 23 I am starting to worry about developing heart disease, something my neurotic nature seems to be a predictor of. Most of my life I've eaten a poor diet (although my cholesterol was only 150, with my LDL at 88 and my HDL at 30. No idea about cortisol, CRP, or interlukins though). 

I have also been pretty sedentary (though that is very slowly starting to change) since I turned 18 and have had a slew of medical problems since then. My gums have receded more (I fought off gingivitis but am on the cusp of developing gum disease from gum recession). I used to get very angry at video games, I developed tinnitus a year ago which drives me crazy, and I'm depressed and socially isolated. 

I have no know history of heart disease, but of depression and low serotonin. Thus I am stuck in a dilemma. I also started taking amphetamine mediation for ADHD in January, so my heart rate tends to be higher on average but I eat less and have lost weight. In some cases, my blood pressure is normal on stimulants even when it feels elevated. I'm paranoid about my health, a bit of hypochondriac. I vape, don't drink anymore, and and am an on and off smoker. 

All of these things and more point to heart disease. I cannot just relax however, and I refuse to take antidepressants. I detest those medications and will take any medicine for depression that is not an antidepressant or antipsychotic. Even at the cost of my life from getting heart disease, I will risk low mood, higher inflammation, and more clotting and an early death than take those. 

I have often been pointed to exercise as the key, which I will do in the form of jogging. I will not do yoga, even if its ""relaxing"" because I think its a stupid form of a exercise. I want a form of exercise where I can feel angry and aggressive. Maybe that defeats the point but at least its something. 

I need some answers within my confines. Diet changes are hard because I'm a picky eater and will throw up if something doesn't taste good. Regular, good sleep is also out of the question because, for some reason, I rarely sleep more than 4-5 hours consecutively. Exercise is pretty easy, I'm just a bit lazy. 

I'm open to ideas but antidepressants are absolutely out of the questions. ",6.22868723849372,7.42309085146444,6.60257060669456,74.3307596757322,66.2175732217573,10.2427824267782,34.8119769874477

I know nothing is wrong with me, except that I used to smoke and am struggling with things like shortness of breath etc. but, every time I get my heart rate up even a little or feel short of breath my anxiety kicks in then quickly turns into a panic attack.

healthanxiety,jrsmusicman,2018/04/10,"Anxiety/Antsy 2 weeks Post-Op Septoplasty/Turbinate Reduction - Need Support Hi all! 

First time poser here. I am a healthy 28 y/o Male who recently just had a Septoplasty/Turbinate reduction 15 days ago. I am a very active guy and usually very ""chill"" and outgoing. 

For those of you who don't know what that is, it's for a deviated septum and you have splints up your nose for a week with a ton of congestion and basically can't do anything while recovering but sit at home (I live by myself with family close by). 

Due to the surgery, I was instructed to not be super active for 2-3 weeks (I am a runner and take boxing classes). So far my nose and breathing feels fine and is healing normally, but the past few days I have been experiencing super anxiety/restlessness/antsy behavior that I have never experienced before in my life. Let me explain a bit.

8 days ago I got the ""splints"" removed from my nose and had a minor complication the day after where my nose bled for 5-6 hours and I went to the ER and they packed it with the most painful ""rhino rocket"" thing up my nose that was the most pain I have experienced in my life. I immediately saw my ENT 6 hours later and she took it out and was pissed they didn't contact her (it was 3am). She said everything looks fine and is healing correctly and gave me the number to call if anything like that happens so she can be contacted.

I got relief that day and was able to take a nap/sleep but the next day I got a migraine I tried to wait out that kept me up all night but ended up taking my imitrex to relieve it. A few days later I got oral thrush (didn't know until the end of the day on Sunday when my Uncle told me what it was an not super serious) with a swollen uvula where I felt as if there was ""something stuck in my throat"" and driving me crazy.

On Sunday I think everything just hit me at once: not being able to workout, being cooped up in my house, the whole trauma of the bloody nose incident, the swollen uvula driving me nuts and not healing as fast as I wanted to, living alone with my dog, etc. I started pacing and my mind was racing to the point where I was like do I need to go to the ER for anxiety or do I need to call my doctor? I have no history of anxiety/depression and have never felt this way before. I am not even close to suicidal thoughts or any self-harm. 

I was able to sit with my Dad and talk for a few hours while watching the Red Sox then have Sunday dinner at my grandma's with my whole family and that helped a lot and by the end of Sunday/Monday I was feeling better (though the oral thrush is still annoying).

Today I had some restlessness/anxiety at work that started resurfacing again like on Sunday but talked to a co-worker who used to struggle big time with it for a bit.

Like a lot of people with h.a., my biggest fear is having a brain tumor.

So, I've had some weird vision things for the past year and I've been to an opthalmologist twice (because the first time wasn't enough apparently). I sometimes see glittery floaters or what appears to be a quick line through my vision. Also, I sometimes have funky peripheral sparkles. My opthalmologist performed intensive tests and said my eyes look extremely healthy. 

I think I'm ""seeing"" these things because of my anxiety and stress of my life as a college student. It's just very concerning it doesn't seem to go away... But the doc probably knows best.

Also commonly, headaches are pretty common...

Finally, maybe once a year I'll have an ocular migraine where I get some weird vision tricks and my lips and fingers seem numb. Although these are probably nothing major I've been wanting to get an MRI just to be sure.

Mother thinks most of this is caused by me over committing to activities and my academic stress in college but some of these symptoms seem so real it's hard to not think it's a neuroloical issue. Ive been told to try deep breathing and  exercise. Have of you experienced these things?

- diarrhea, constipation
- pain on the right side of abdomen for over a year now, it comes and goes, now it's mostly in my upper back

I found Balamuthia Mandrillaris. FML. Fast forward two days. My eyes hurt, like they're tired. I had some brief photo sensitivity, but I attributed that to playing Skyrim all day yesterday in an attempt to maintain control over my thoughts. My sinuses are still full, but I'm not congested. I can feel popping and pressure in there, but no snot and I can breathe fine. My irrational brain tells me that this is a direct result of amoeba eating away my soft tissue. It is not possible for this to be run of the mill allergies or a sinus infection. My head doesn't throb or anything. It's a like a sinus headache, but very vague. I can move my neck and all just fine. I don't know if I have a fever. The kid hid the thermometer some where. It's messed up, I felt fine when I woke up this morning. No nasal problems. It wasn't until later on it started up again. Now my face is twitching in weird places. Which I read is also a symptom of the amoeba infection. 

I already know this is rare. I've researched it thoroughly. I'm scheduled to see my doctor tomorrow, but I want to go to the ER. I can't just up and take my kid with me though. I can't let this shit disrupt her life. She's spent many hours with me in the ER already. What am I supposed to do though? I know something isn't right. I don't want to die.

I have a long history of health anxiety. Can’t get a cold without convincing myself I might be dieing. Frequent rabies scares. I’ve convinced myself something was seriously wrong a couple times a month for years. I’ve mostly talked myself out of seeing a doctor because I know it’s just anxiety and I don’t want doctors to think I’m crazy or wasting their time.

A few days ago though... I found a lump under the skin above my right rib cage. So I did the logical thing and poked around for a lump on my left side... I thought maybe I felt a smaller similar lump and talked myself off the ledge.

But now I can actually see a lump on my right side in the mirror. And when I prod around, it feels like there might be a cluster of small lumps (only one is visible though).

So... of course I’m worried it might be cancer although Dr. Google tells me there’s all sorts of benign explanations.

I’m currently talking myself into seeing a doctor for peace of mind. But I hate the doubt telling me this is anxiety and I’ll be wasting the doctor’s time. I’m terrified the doctor will label me with hypochondria.

healthanxiety,UninspiringNucleon,2018/04/14,"‘Palpable lymph node’ - I’m terrified... So two and a half weeks ago, I went to the dentist with a tooth that was shaky after a previous filling had fallen out. I’d been feeling a bit weird in my throat, on the same side too. 

She looked it and firstly said, it appears I have gingivitis. 

She had to extract my tooth (surgically, by altering the gums) and said it was infected, so put some medicine in it and temporarily closed it. The next day, I went back and she opened it all up and then sutured my gums back together. 

When she checked my lymph nodes (mainly under my neck), I directed her to the mandibular node, which had been noticeably hard for maybe a week before. She called it a palpable node and said it could be due to the infection and the antibiotics (amoxicillin) she prescribed should take care of the infection. 

Well, almost three weeks later and I’m freaking the f*ck out. My infection appears gone and I’ve had no pain on that side since the extraction. 

My lymph node is still as palpable as before, but what’s worrying me is that it’s painless, whereas when it’s an infection it’s usually quite tender? It’s hard but a bit rubbery and moves around. It could’ve been around a lot longer than just the three weeks it’s been since I need to push it out a little from against my jaw to feel it - but I can REALLY feel it. 

I had a couple of random lumps in my armpit, groin and side as well, and whilst it felt hard, they had sort of pus coming out of the end so I assumed they were harmless as they went down after a couple of days. This was before the dentist. 

I’m scared it’s lymphoma. The reason for this is:

-Night sweats - I’ve had this on/off for the past few years however. But I’ve noticed it again despite keeping cool. 
-Temperature regulation - out of nowhere I’ll get quite warm and then get a bit chilly again. 
-The node is pretty much painless but despite the infection going, it’s still the same size and hardness. 
-General fatigue (but I have that anyways), recently it’s been muscle aches
-I’m a smoker... and at times in the past year I’ve been very heavy. 

I’m just freaking the fck out. Can anyone let me know if they had anything similar? Or just put my mind at ease?

I know I should go to the doctors but I’ve just built up such a resistance to it with how much anxiety I’ve had over it. I fear having to face the issue and find out I have something serious.

I haven't had a UTI for about 5 years (I'm a 27 yo F) but about a month ago, I was in China and got one. Went to the doctor to get antibiotics, took them for 5 days. 2 days later, I developed super intense middle super low abdominal pain that almost made me faint - Broke out into a sweat, couldn't stand, ears began ringing.

Went to hospital where they ran some tests and said the infection was still there, so they gave me another batch of antibiotics. These made me feel super ill every night (btw, at this point, the UTI stinging symptom is long gone) and by the 5th night I felt sick af and was vomiting.

Went to hospital the day after and I still had the infection. So, 3rd batch of antibiotics. Went to hospital the 3rd night because I was nervous I had a UTI that lasted so long. They told me I still had an infection and that it was severe, So I should stay at hospital. Didn't feel comfortable doing that in a foreign country, so I got on a plane to Melbourne (where I'm from) the next day. 

Dad picked me up and took me to hospital. I did indeed still have an infection so they gave me a new batch and sent me on my way - I was asymptomatic at that point. 3 days later, I have muscle aches in my leg, I start feeling super weak, and my heart rate was really high (180 when I arrived at emergency) shortly after being admitted, I developed diarrhea. Doctor on duty thought I might have an undertreated UTI, so they administered new antibiotic via IV. I was discharged the  next morning.

Considering how long this UTI lasted, I followed up and had a new urine test 8 days later (last Monday) Called my GP's office last Wednesday and the results were normal (yay!) But was feeling worried because since Tuesday, I felt ultra uncomfortable in that region down there. Had an ultrasound on Thursday and went back to the doctor on Friday explaining my concerns. He told me my test results from earlier in the week were completely normal so it was highly unlikely anything was wrong. Gave me some tablets they apparently usually give to ""old ladies"" with bladder issues.

healthanxiety,FeatheredDrake,2018/04/15,"I might be dying, and my anxiety is going nuts I might have messed up yesterday. I'm an avid codeine user. I don't do hard drugs because I'm too scared of damaging my brain or other organs, but over the years, it has become increasingly difficult to lead a normal life without the help of a substance, considering that I have severe anxiety, depression, depersonalization, derealization and Pure O. So I started to consume codeine once in a few weeks in order to be able to function correctly, since I've tried around 20 antidepressants and SSRIs and nothing worked for me.

Yesterday, I took another dose. I buy OTC pain relief pills which contain codeine phosphate but they also contain paracetamol (acetaminophen) and aspirin and, in order to stay safe, you need to do a cold water extraction in order to remove the acetaminophen and aspirin from the pills. Opioids are highly soluble in water, so the codeine dissolves and the other ingredients  get filtered through a fabric and removed from the water, leaving a crystal-clear substance containing just codeine. However, I was in a hurry yesterday (stupid excuse to overlook my safety, I know) and I didn't wait long enough for the water to reach the right temperature (it needs to be around freezing temperature, but not frozen) and I did the extraction anyway. The water came out very milky and that is a sign that the extraction was not successful. I didn't know the water needs to be COMPLETELY clear and I didn't look it up...I took the substance anyway.

A few hours later I did some reserch and found out that I might have potentially intested 4 grams of paracetamol and 5 grams or aspirin. 4 grams of paracetamol is a risky amount, because it can cause liver damage. The liver, then, continues to self-destruct over a period of 2 weeks (!!!) without showing any serious physical symptoms so there's no way to know whether I overdosed or not...it ultimately leads to necrosis and then painful, slow death.

Then I started noticing that my digestive system was totally out of whack, and was experiencing a constant fatigue and strange stomach aches that would appear out of nowhere in my lower abdomen. The aches would be sharp and burning, I felt like I got a ""hot flash"", and then they would go away after only 1 or 2 minutes and I'd feel fine. 

So I convinced myself I had a stomach ulcer (thanks, WebMD). I conquered my health anxiety once again and returned to the doctor. Up to this point, I've never had any real health issues in my life and pretty much never went to the doctor unless I got sick. (Except that I was diagnosed with high risk HPV, which had recently been clearing up. That's another story). So they do a breath test for H.pylori and take my blood. The blood test shows I have elevated bilirubin and they do an abdominal x-ray and ultrasound. No stomach ulcer. And nothing in the x-ray or ultrasound that indicates something wrong with my organs. 

Around this time I begin having panic attacks because I feel like something is very wrong with me. And then, my skin on my face goes insane. Small red bumps everywhere and flaking off all over and so much redness. I get a prescription cream, and it gets worse. I also get a prescription for a mild anxiety medication. The anxiety medicine makes me feel SO light headed, which triggers more anxiety because I feel light headed when I have a panic attack. 

I started a gluten-free diet because I felt like it matched some of my symptoms. Started taking probiotics every day and my digestive issues have gotten so so much better. I went in for a follow-up blood test that showed my bilirubin levels are now normal. I realized the lightheadedness of my medication was caused by consuming grapefruit. I've finally gotten my skin under control with daily chemical peels and tea tree oil and it's improved a lot, though still nothing like it used to be.  

So I've made a lot of progress. However I still feel very fatigued most days. While gluten-free has definitely helped, and I think I'm getting a better hold on my anxiety, in the back of mind I'm still afraid something is wrong. Can anyone relate? I'm reminding myself that I've made a lot of progress, and I think my initial health scare just triggered this health anxiety that I had never had before.

healthanxiety,wildpantz,2018/04/16,"Stomach related cancer Hey guys....I've been having problems with my stomach lately, it started on September. Basically, I had tons of things to do on my uni, got really stressed out and started feeling like my stomach, or better yet the area above it felt heavy. I started running by that time and I ran almost every day until the real winter kicked in (around two month period). I also started eating more healthy and I stopped eating after 7PM for quite some time. While I ran I almost felt as if a weight was in my chest and as if it was jumping while I was running, so I visited my doc.

In the meantime, I lost quite some weight. I was usually around 100kg (+-5), and last time I tracked my weight I was at 83.

The doc basically said it's all stress related and she took my blood, urine and stool sample.

Stool -&gt; negative for H. Pylori
Urine -&gt; everything good, except high amount of proteins in urine (I had wisdom teeth extracted and took antibiotics a week before, so I'm not sure if it's related to that, if anyone has something smart to say regarding this...please do)
Blood -&gt; All good

She gave me a prescription for Controloc pills (proton pump inhibitor) and told me to take them for two weeks at least.

Well, newsflah. I'm stupid. First of all, I started taking them and the situation improved. So I stopped taking them after around 5 days, forgot one day and figured oh well, if it doesn't hurt it's fixed. Then, another period of high intensity workload on uni arrived and so did the pain. I started taking them again, but for a week and it improved a little. Later I figured I won't be my own doctor and I stopped taking them, so for a while I felt just a minor annoyance above stomach, but nothing alarming or hurting so I ignored it.

Now, back to another high intensity period, my stomach is going crazy again, I google, telling myself not to do it, but hey, I said I'm stupid didn't I?

The moment I read about bla bla cancers of this and that caused by gastritis I totally lost it.

If I had these symptoms on and off, considering I didn't take my meds as I was supposed to, how bad did I fk up my stomach? Could this half a year have made any permanent damage? I'm terribly afraid of well...pain, doctors, disease and death, nice combo, in fact so nice that it keeps me scared, but not scared enough to face my fear of doctors and operations.

Yesterday it was hell, I took 2x20mg Acipan (same thing as Controloc basically) and I feel a lot better, but my mind is still in a terrible place. I guess this turned out into a rant, rather than a question, but still... any comments are welcome.

sidenote: I read that the usual period of taking controloc or similar pills for such symptoms is at least 4 weeks, considering I didn't take even 1/4 of the given time, is it possible it's simply the gastritis coming back every time?",4.00205895958619,5.61998178842677,4.98109676605408,82.256492283107,71.9837251356239,7.89282980781362,28.4120021868035

I, like many of you, have been dealing with debilitating health anxiety - specifically, concerning me focusing on my stomach, kidneys and waste (literally examining every urine and bowel movement).  I have been to the doctor 3 times already, have done 2x blood tests and a stool test, and everything came back okay, yet I am still unconvinced, a feeling I'm sure many of you can relate to.

I suspected MS - did an MRI, an SSEP - they found nothing. Then, I moved onto ALS. Nothing again. Several neurologists said I had nothing but anxiety, and still I kept thinking the opposite.

In January I woke up with my right side tingling/pins and needles, followed by a toothache. Of course, I googled these symptoms and found Trigeminal Neuralgia - a condition that checks all the boxes of a hypochondriac nightmare.

I had a cavity, did a root canal, the toothache disappeared. But the tingling is still here and around my eye I have been dealing with burning sensations - eyelid, eyelashes, inside the eye. It's not unbearable and maddening like those who have trigeminal neuralgia say it is, but it's really uncomfortable.

I've seen two major neurosurgeons about this, they said I didn't have trigeminal neuralgia. I don't know, I can't find peace, I'm always startled, nervous and expecting to be hit by a major wave of unbearable pain. 

I really don't know anything anymore. Don't know if is my HA causing this, or if in fact I have this condition but doctors are simply being dismissive.

That Thursday I decided to start eating again, so me and the family went to eat Mexican. I ate a small plate of fajitas (not spicy). On the way home I felt my heart rate go WAY up and started pounding really hard. Then I started to feel like my chest was tight and I couldn’t breathe properly and my hands and face began to get pins and needles. The pins and needles spread all over my body and I got this enormous pressure in my lower diaphragm. All of my joints locked up and I couldn’t move. I could speak but it was slurred. They took me to the ER and after taking several tests including a EKG a CT scan of my brain and a battery of blood tests, they concluded it was a low potassium level in my body, which triggered a panic attack. Ok. So the next Tuesday I went to my primary care doctor for a follow up to check my potassium level, and on the way I began to get that tingling and pressure in my chest again, I pulled over, got something to drink, and made it to the doctors office. Potassium came back fine. The feeling didn’t go away. All the rest of that day I felt like I couldn’t breathe. The next day I went to a minor emergency center and after even more tests on my heart lungs and veins, they concluded that I was fine and it was probably just anxiety. 3 days later. Went to the ER because the feeling still hasn’t gone away and it is getting hard to live my life. Same thing, a bunch of tests and concluded nothing. Doctor said it might be a ulcer in my stomach and put me on medication. One week later and it only got worse. I went back to the ER and they took even more extensive tests and still found nothing.

Anyway, thanks for letting me get this off my chest. ",4.37849624060151,5.11774525358852,4.45989405331511,89.6767583732058,70.1483253588517,7.50252904989747,28.8041695146958

healthanxiety,ButtDumplin,2018/04/18,"Your honest opinions, please! Ok, so I have struggled with hypochondria for going on three years now. 

Last night, my girlfriend was puppy sitting for a coworker, and I stopped by to bring dinner and hang out with the cute puppy, for a while.

As puppies do, he was a little bit of a biter, and at one point he got in a little deep just above my elbow on my bicep. I pulled my arm away but it dragged a little bit and drew a little blood, so i assumed it punctured the skin. 

He's only a few months old, and apparently he went to the veterinarian four days ago. I haven't confirmed that he got a rabies vaccination there. I think he would have, but I don't remember what all my dog got when i took him home two years ago. This puppy who bit me came from a shelter. 

So, please tell me honestly: should I be worried about rabies? Should I go to the doctor just in case? I could use a level head's perspective on this.",4.30363063063063,4.78236977297297,5.15655405405405,85.5514076576577,70.1891891891892,7.68018018018018,26.2274774774775
healthanxiety,gloriagoodwin,2018/04/19,"Terrified I have myocarditis and will suddenly die soon I've been suffering cold-like viral symptoms for the last 10 days, and I'm terrified the virus will attack my heart in a condition known as myocarditis. It began as a sore throat and a constant need to clear my throat, but has now progressed to a hacking, productive cough. I have also had some chest pain today, although admittedly it feels muscular.

Roughly 4 days into my symptoms (6 days ago now) I went to ER and they performed ECG and took blood. Cardiac troponins were not elevated and ECG was normal. However, I can't get my mind off the idea that because my viral symptoms have worsened, the virus is attacking my heart and I now have myocarditis.

Is it worth going to ER again for an ECG and cardiac troponins to put my mind at ease? I've been reading reports over at the myocarditis foundation website and what strikes me as particularly terrifying about this disease is its tendency to randomly cause sudden death without prior warning. 

I mean, as a health anxiety sufferer whose condition arises from a fear of death, this is the worst illness I ever could've learned about. ",8.82555023923445,8.55270169856459,8.4755023923445,68.1385167464115,60.7224880382775,12.0019138755981,41.488038277512

I got finished with an eye doctor appointment who told me my eyes were fine (the initial cause of this), got one night of rest (after 3 weeks of anxious manic hell) and it started up the next day. It moved from my eyes to other health concerns. It just never stops. I've talked to my therapist but I don't know when I'll see my psychiatrist next. I'm losing sleep. I'm barely hanging in there.

Sleeping is the worst. I can't at all. I toss and turn. Wake up from panic attacks. Have vivid nightmares. It's just all gone to hell after years of building up and I don't know what to do. I've attempted grounding, meditation, nature sounds, reassuring myself, etc etc. It builds back up.

I'm not sure where to go next or what to do. Maybe more doctor appointments, if it even helps anymore. Sometimes I think they're lying to me.
